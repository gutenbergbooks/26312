			Dust</h4>

			<p>The population of the civilised world to-day
			may be divided into two classes,—millionaires
			and those who would like to be
			millionaires. The rest are artists, poets,
			tramps, and babies—and do not count. Poets
			and artists do not count until after they are
			dead. Tramps are put in prison. Babies are
			expected to get over it. A few more summers,
			a few more winters—with short skirts or with
			down on their chins—they shall be seen burrowing
			with the rest of us.</p>

			<p>One almost wonders sometimes, why it is
			that the sun keeps on year after year and day
			after day turning the globe around and around,
			heating it and lighting it and keeping things
			growing on it, when after all, when all is said
			and done (crowded with wonder and with
			things to live with, as it is), it is a comparatively
			empty globe. No one seems to be using
			it very much, or paying very much attention
			to it, or getting very much out of it. There
			are never more than a very few men on it at a
			time, who can be said to be really living on it.
			They are engaged in getting a living and in
			hoping that they are going to live sometime.
			They are also going to read sometime.</p>

			<p>When one thinks of the wasted sunrises and
			sunsets—the great free show of heaven—the
			<a class="pagenum" id="page6" title="6"> </a>door open every night—of the little groups of
			people straggling into it—of the swarms of
			people hurrying back and forth before it,
			jostling their getting-a-living lives up and
			down before it, not knowing it is there,—one
			wonders why it is there. Why does it not fall
			upon us, or its lights go suddenly out upon us?
			We stand in the days and the nights like stalls—suns
			flying over our heads, stars singing
			through space beneath our feet. But we do
			not see. Every man’s head in a pocket,—boring
			for his living in a pocket—or being bored
			for his living in a pocket,—why should he see?
			True we are not without a philosophy for this—to
			look over the edge of our stalls with.
			“Getting a living is living,” we say. We
			whisper it to ourselves—in our pockets. Then
			we try to get it. When we get it, we try to
			believe it—and when we get it we do not believe
			anything. Let every man under the
			walled-in heaven, the iron heaven, speak for
			his own soul. No one else shall speak for
			him. We only know what we know—each of
			us in our own pockets. The great books tell
			us it has not always been an iron heaven or a
			walled-in heaven. But into the faces of the
			flocks of the children that come to us, year
			after year, we look, wondering. They shall
			not do anything but burrowing—most of them.
			Our very ideals are burrowings. So are our
			books. Religion burrows. It barely so much
			as looks at heaven. Why should a civilised man—a
			<a class="pagenum" id="page7" title="7"> </a>man who has a pocket in civilisation—a
			man who can burrow—look at heaven? It
			is the glimmering boundary line where burrowing
			leaves off. Time enough. In the meantime
			the shovel. Let the stars wheel. Do
			men look at stars with shovels?</p>

			<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

			<p class="post_thoughtbreak">The faults of our prevailing habits of reading
			are the faults of our lives. Any criticism
			of our habit of reading books to-day, which
			actually or even apparently confines itself to
			the point, is unsatisfactory. A criticism of the
			reading habit of a nation is a criticism of its
			civilisation. To sketch a scheme of defence
			for the modern human brain, from the kindergarten
			stage to Commencement day, is merely
			a way of bringing the subject of education up,
			and dropping it where it begins.</p>

			<p>Even if the youth of the period, as a live,
			human, reading being (on the principles to be
			laid down in the following pages), is so fortunate
			as to succeed in escaping the dangers and
			temptations of the home—even if he contrives
			to run the gauntlet of the grammar school and
			the academy—even if, in the last, longest, and
			hardest pull of all, he succeeds in keeping a
			spontaneous habit with books in spite of a college
			course, the story is not over. Civilisation
			waits for him—all-enfolding, all-instructing
			civilisation, and he stands face to face—book
			in hand—with his last chance.</p>

			Dust to Dust</h4>

			<p>Whatever else may be said of our present
			civilisation, one must needs go very far in it to
			see Abraham at his tent’s door, waiting for
			angels. And yet, from the point of view of
			reading and from the point of view of the books
			that the world has always called worth reading,
			if ever there was a type of a gentleman
			and scholar in history, and a Christian, and a
			man of possibilities, founder and ruler of
			civilisations, it is this same man Abraham
			at his tent’s door waiting for angels. Have
			we any like him now? Peradventure there
			shall be twenty? Peradventure there shall
			be ten? Where is the man who feels that
			he is free to-day to sit upon his steps and have
			a quiet think, unless there floats across the
			spirit of his dream the sweet and reassuring
			sound of some one making a tremendous din
			around the next corner—a band, or a new literary
			journal, or a historical novel, or a special
			correspondent, or a new club or church or
			something? Until he feels that the world is
			being conducted for him, that things are tolerably
			not at rest, where shall one find in civilisation,
			in this present moment, a man who is
			ready to stop and look about him—to take a
			spell at last at being a reasonable, contemplative,
			or even marriageable being?</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page9" title="9"> </a>The essential unmarriageableness of the
			modern man and the unreadableness of his
			books are two facts that work very well together.</p>

			<p>When Emerson asked Bronson Alcott
			“What have you done in the world, what
			have you written?” the answer of Alcott, “If
			Pythagoras came to Concord whom would he
			ask to see?” was a diagnosis of the whole
			nineteenth century. It was a very short sentence,
			but it was a sentence to found a college
			with, to build libraries out of, to make a whole
			modern world read, to fill the weary and heedless
			heart of it—for a thousand years.</p>

			<p>We have plenty of provision made for books
			in civilisation, but if civilisation should ever
			have another man in the course of time who
			knows how to read a book, it would not know
			what to do with him. No provision is made
			for such a man. We have nothing but libraries—monstrous
			libraries to lose him in.
			The books take up nearly all the room in
			civilisation, and civilisation takes up the rest.
			The man is not allowed to peep in civilisation.
			He is too busy in being ordered around by
			it to know that he would like to. It does
			not occur to him that he ought to be allowed
			time in it to know who he is, before he dies.
			The typical civilised man is an exhausted,
			spiritually hysterical man because he has no
			idea of what it means, or can be made to mean
			to a man, to face calmly with his whole life a
			<a class="pagenum" id="page10" title="10"> </a>great book, a few minutes every day, to rest
			back on his ideals in it, to keep office hours
			with his own soul.</p>

			<p>The practical value of a book is the inherent
			energy and quietness of the ideals in it—the
			immemorial way ideals have—have always had—of
			working themselves out in a man, of doing
			the work of the man and of doing their own
			work at the same time.</p>

			<p>Inasmuch as ideals are what all real books
			are written with and read with, and inasmuch
			as ideals are the only known way a human
			being has of resting, in this present world, it
			would be hard to think of any book that would
			be more to the point in this modern civilisation
			than a book that shall tell men how to read to
			live,—how to touch their ideals swiftly every
			day. Any book that should do this for us
			would touch life at more points and flow out
			on men’s minds in more directions than any
			other that could be conceived. It would contribute
			as the June day, or as the night for
			sleep, to all men’s lives, to all of the problems
			of all of the world at once. It would be a
			night latch—to the ideal.</p>

			<p>Whatever the remedy may be said to be, one
			thing is certainly true with regard to our reading
			habits in modern times. Men who are
			habitually shamefaced or absent-minded before
			the ideal—that is, before the actual nature
			of things—cannot expect to be real readers of
			books. They can only be what most men
			<a class="pagenum" id="page11" title="11"> </a>are nowadays, merely busy and effeminate,
			running-and-reading sort of men—rushing
			about propping up the universe. Men who
			cannot trust the ideal—the nature of things,—and
			who think they can do better, are naturally
			kept very busy, and as they take no time
			to rest back on their ideals they are naturally
			very tired. The result stares at us on every
			hand. Whether in religion, art, education, or
			public affairs, we do not stop to find our ideals
			for the problems that confront us. We do
			not even look at them. Our modern problems
			are all Jerichos to us—most of them paper
			ones. We arrange symposiums and processions
			around them and shout at them and march up
			and down before them. Modern prophecy is
			the blare of the trumpet. Modern thought is
			a crowd hurrying to and fro. Civilisation is
			the dust we scuffle in each other’s eyes.</p>

			<p>When the peace and strength of spirit with
			which the walls of temples are builded no
			longer dwell in them, the stones crumble.
			Temples are built of eon-gathered and eon-rested
			stones. Infinite nights and days are
			wrought in them, and leisure and splendour
			wait upon them, and visits of suns and stars,
			and when leisure and splendour are no more in
			human beings’ lives, and visits of suns and
			stars are as though they were not, in our
			civilisation, the walls of it shall crumble upon
			us. If fulness and leisure and power of living
			are no more with us, nothing shall save us.
			<a class="pagenum" id="page12" title="12"> </a>Walls of encyclopædias—not even walls of
			Bibles shall save us, nor miles of Carnegie-library.
			Empty and hasty and cowardly living
			does not get itself protected from the laws of
			nature by tons of paper and ink. The only
			way out for civilisation is through the practical
			men in it—men who grapple daily with
			ideals, who keep office hours with their souls,
			who keep hold of life with books, who take
			enough time out of hurrahing civilisation
			along—to live.</p>

			<p>Civilisation has been long in building and
			its splendour still hangs over us, but Parthenons
			do not stand when Parthenons are no longer
			being lived in Greek men’s souls. Only those
			who have Coliseums in them can keep Coliseums
			around them. The Ideal has its own
			way. It has it with the very stones. It was
			an Ideal, a vanished Ideal, that made a moonlight
			scene for tourists out of the Coliseum—out
			of the Dead Soul of Rome.</p>

			Ashes</h4>

			<p>There seem to be but two fundamental characteristic
			sensibilities left alive in the typical,
			callously-civilised man. One of these sensibilities
			is the sense of motion and the other is the
			sense of mass. If he cannot be appealed to
			through one of these senses, it is of little use
			<a class="pagenum" id="page13" title="13"> </a>to appeal to him at all. In proportion as he
			is civilised, the civilised man can be depended
			on for two things. He can always be touched
			by a hurry of any kind, and he never fails to
			be moved by a crowd. If he can have hurry
			and crowd together, he is capable of almost
			anything. These two sensibilities, the sense
			of motion and the sense of mass, are all that is
			left of the original, lusty, tasting and seeing
			and feeling human being who took possession
			of the earth. And even in the case of comparatively
			rudimentary and somewhat stupid
			senses like these, the sense of motion, with the
			average civilised man, is so blunt that he needs
			to be rushed along at seventy miles an hour to
			have the feeling that he is moving, and his
			sense of mass is so degenerate that he needs to
			live with hundreds of thousands of people next
			door to know that he is not alone. He is seen
			in his most natural state,—this civilised being,—with
			most of his civilisation around him, in
			the seat of an elevated railway train, with a
			crowded newspaper before his eyes, and another
			crowded newspaper in his lap, and crowds of
			people reading crowded newspapers standing
			round him in the aisles; but he can never be
			said to be seen at his best, in a spectacle like
			this, until the spectacle moves, until it is felt
			rushing over the sky of the street, puffing
			through space; in which delectable pell-mell
			and carnival of hurry—hiss in front of it, shriek
			under it, and dust behind it—he finds, to all
			<a class="pagenum" id="page14" title="14"> </a>appearances at least, the meaning of this present
			world and the hope of the next. Hurry and
			crowd have kissed each other and his soul
			rests. “If Abraham sitting in his tent door
			waiting for angels had been visited by a spectacle
			like this and invited to live in it all his
			days, would he not have climbed into it cheerfully
			enough?” asks the modern man. Living
			in a tent would have been out of the question,
			and waiting for angels—waiting for anything,
			in fact—forever impossible.</p>

			<p>Whatever else may be said of Abraham, his
			waiting for angels was the making of him, and
			the making of all that is good in what has followed
			since. The man who hangs on a strap—up
			in the morning and down at night, hurrying
			between the crowd he sleeps with and the
			crowd he works with, to the crowd that hurries
			no more,—even this man, such as he is, with
			all his civilisation roaring about him, would
			have been impossible if Abraham in the stately
			and quiet days had not waited at his tent door
			for angels to begin a civilisation with, or if he
			had been the kind of Abraham that expected
			that angels would come hurrying and scurrying
			after one in a spectacle like this. “What
			has a man,” says Blank in his <cite>Angels of the
			Nineteenth Century</cite>,—“What has a man who
			consents to be a knee-bumping, elbow-jamming,
			foothold-struggling strap-hanger—an
			abject commuter all his days (for no better
			reason than that he is not well enough to keep
			<a class="pagenum" id="page15" title="15"> </a>still and that there is not enough of him to be
			alone)—to do with angels—or to do with anything,
			except to get done with it as fast as he
			can?” So say we all of us, hanging on straps
			to say it, swaying and swinging to oblivion.
			“Is there no power,” says Blank, “in heaven
			above or earth beneath that will <em>help us to
			stop?</em>”</p>

			<p>If a civilisation is founded on two senses—the
			sense of motion and the sense of mass,—one
			need not go far to find the essential traits
			of its literature and its daily reading habit.
			There are two things that such a civilisation
			makes sure of in all its concerns—hurry and
			crowd. Hence the spectacle before us—the
			literary rush and mobs of books.</p>

			The Literary Rush</h4>

			<p>The present writer, being occasionally addicted
			(like the reader of this book) to a seemly
			desire to have the opinions of some one besides
			the author represented, has fallen into the way
			of having interviews held with himself from
			time to time, which are afterwards published at
			his own request. These interviews appear in
			the public prints as being between a Mysterious
			Person and The Presiding Genius of the State of
			Massachusetts. The author can only earnestly
			hope that in thus generously providing for an
			<a class="pagenum" id="page16" title="16"> </a>opposing point of view, in taking, as it were,
			the words of the enemy upon his lips, he will
			lose the sympathy of the reader. The Mysterious
			Person is in colloquy with The Presiding
			Genius of the State of Massachusetts. As
			The P. G. S. of M. lives relentlessly at his
			elbow—dogs every day of his life,—it is hoped
			that the reader will make allowance for a certain
			impatient familiarity in the tone of The
			Mysterious Person toward so considerable a
			personage as The Presiding Genius of the State
			of Massachusetts—which we can only profoundly
			regret.</p>

			<p>The Mysterious Person: “There is no escaping
			from it. Reading-madness is a thing we
			all are breathing in to-day whether we will or
			no, and it is not only in the air, but it is worse
			than in the air. It is underneath the foundations
			of the things in which we live and on
			which we stand. It has infected the very
			character of the natural world, and the movement
			of the planets, and the whirl of the globe
			beneath our feet. Without its little paling of
			books about it, there is hardly a thing that is
			left in this modern world a man can go to for
			its own sake. Except by stepping off the
			globe, perhaps, now and then—practically
			arranging a world of one’s own, and breaking
			with one’s kind,—the life that a man must live
			to-day can only be described as a kind of eternal
			parting with himself. There is getting to
			be no possible way for a man to preserve his
			<a class="pagenum" id="page17" title="17"> </a>five spiritual senses—even his five physical
			ones—and be a member, in good and regular
			standing, of civilisation at the same time.</p>

			<p>“If civilisation and human nature are to
			continue to be allowed to exist together there
			is but one way out, apparently—an extra
			planet for all of us, one for a man to live on
			and the other for him to be civilised on.”</p>

			<p>P. G. S. of M.: <span class="keep_together">“But——”</span></p>

			<p>“As long as we, who are the men and women
			of the world, are willing to continue our present
			fashion of giving up living in order to get
			a living, one planet will never be large enough
			for us. If we can only get our living in one
			place and have it to live with in another, the
			question is, To whom does this present planet
			belong—the people who spend their days in
			living into it and enjoying it, or the people
			who never take time to notice the planet, who
			do not seem to know that they are living on a
			planet at all?”</p>

			<p>P. G. S. of M.: <span class="keep_together">“But——”</span></p>

			<p>“I may not be very well informed on very
			many things, but I am very sure of one of
			them,” said The Mysterious Person, “and that
			is, that this present planet—this one we are
			living on now—belongs by all that is fair and
			just to those who are really living on it, and
			that it should be saved and kept as a sacred
			and protected place—a place where men shall
			be able to belong to the taste and colour and
			meaning of things and to God and to themselves.
			<a class="pagenum" id="page18" title="18"> </a>If people want another planet—a
			planet to belong to Society on,—let them go
			out and get it.</p>

			<p>“Look at our literature—current literature.
			It is a mere headlong, helpless literary rush
			from beginning to end. All that one can extract
			from it is getting to be a kind of general
			sound of going. We began gently enough.
			We began with the annual. We had Poor
			Richard’s Almanac. Then we had the quarterly.
			A monthly was reasonable enough in
			course of time; so we had monthlies. Then
			the semi-monthly came to ease our literary
			nerves; and now the weekly magazine
			stumbles, rapt and wistful, on the heels of men
			of genius. It makes contracts for prophecy.
			Unborn poems are sold in the open market.
			The latest thoughts that thinkers have, the
			trend of the thoughts they are going to have—the
			public makes demand for these. It gets
			them. Then it cries ‘More! More!’ Where
			is the writer who does not think with the
			printing-press hot upon his track, and the
			sound of the pulp-mill making paper for his
			poems, and the buzz of editors, instead of the
			music of the spheres? Think of the destruction
			to American forests, the bare and glaring
			hills that face us day and night, all for a literature
			like this—thousands of square miles of it,
			spread before our faces, morning after morning,
			week after week, through all this broad
			and glorious land! Seventy million souls—brothers
			<a class="pagenum" id="page19" title="19"> </a>of yours and mine—walking through
			prairies of pictures Sunday after Sunday, flickered
			at by head-lines, deceived by adjectives,
			each with his long day’s work, column after
			column, sentence after sentence, plodding—plodding—plodding
			down to <span class="keep_together">——.</span> My geography
			may be wrong; the general direction is
			right.”</p>

			<p>“But don’t you believe in newspapers?”</p>

			<p>“Why, yes, in the abstract; <em>news</em>papers.
			But we do not have any news nowadays. It is
			not news to know a thing before it’s happened,
			nor is it news to know what might happen, or
			why it might happen, or why it might not
			happen. To be told that it doesn’t make
			any difference whether it happens at all,
			would be news, perhaps, to many people—such
			news as there is; but it is hardly
			worth while to pay three cents to be sure of
			that. An intelligent man can be sure of it for
			nothing. He has been sure of it every morning
			for years. It’s the gist of most of the
			newspapers he reads. From the point of view
			of what can be called truly vital information,
			in any larger sense, the only news a daily
			paper has is the date at the top of the page.
			If a man once makes sure of that, if he feels
			from the bottom of his heart what really good
			news it is that one more day is come in a world
			as beautiful as this,—the rest of <span class="keep_together">it——”</span></p>

			<p>P. G. S. of M.: <span class="keep_together">“But——”</span></p>

			<p>“The rest of it, if it’s true, is hardly worth
			<a class="pagenum" id="page20" title="20"> </a>knowing; and if it’s worth knowing, it can be
			found better in books; and if it’s not true—‘Every
			man his own liar’ is my motto. He
			might as well have the pleasure of it, and he
			knows how much to believe. The same lunging,
			garrulous, blindly busy habit is the law of
			all we do. Take our literary critical journals.
			If a critic can not tell what he sees at once, he
			must tell what he fails to see at once. The
			point is not his seeing or not seeing, nor anybody’s
			seeing or not seeing. The point is the
			imperative ‘at once.’ Literature is getting to
			be the filling of orders—time-limited orders.
			Criticism is out of a car window. Book reviews
			are telegraphed across the sea (Tennyson’s
			memoirs). The —— (Daily) —— (a
			spectacle for Homer!) begins a magazine to ‘review
			in three weeks every book of permanent
			value that is published’—one of the gravest
			and most significant blows at literature—one
			of the gravest and most significant signs of the
			condition of letters to-day—that could be conceived!
			Three weeks, man! As if a ‘book of
			permanent value’ had ever been recognised, as
			yet, in three years, or reviewed in thirty years
			(in any proper sense), or mastered in three
			hundred years—with all the hurrying of this
			hurrying world! We have no book-reviewers.
			Why should we? Criticism begins where a
			man’s soul leaves off. It comes from brilliantly-defective
			minds,—so far as one can see,—from
			men of attractively imperfect sympathies.
			<a class="pagenum" id="page21" title="21"> </a>Nordau, working himself into a mighty
			wrath because mystery is left out of his soul,
			gathering adjectives about his loins, stalks this
			little fluttered modern world, puts his huge,
			fumbling, hippopotamus hoof upon the <cite>Blessed
			Damozel</cite>, goes crashing through the press. He
			is greeted with a shudder of delight. Even
			Matthew Arnold, a man who had a way of seeing
			things almost, sometimes, criticises Emerson
			for lack of unity, because the unity was on
			so large a scale that Arnold’s imagination could
			not see it; and now the chirrup from afar, rising
			from the east and the west, ‘Why doesn’t
			George Meredith?’ etc. People want him to
			put guide-posts in his books, apparently, or
			before his sentences: ‘<span class="small_all_caps">TO ——</span>’ or ‘<span class="small_all_caps">TEN MILES
			TO THE NEAREST VERB</span>’—the inevitable fate of
			any writer, man or woman, who dares to ask,
			in this present day, that his reader shall stop
			to think. If a man cannot read as he runs, he
			does not read a book at all. The result is, he
			ought to run; that is natural enough; and the
			faster he runs, in most books, the better.”</p>

			<p>At this point The Mysterious Person reached
			out his long arm from his easy-chair to some
			papers that were lying near. I knew too well
			what it meant. He began to read. (He is
			always breaking over into manuscript when he
			talks.)</p>

			<p>“We are forgetting to see. Looking is a
			lost art. With our poor, wistful, straining
			eyes, we hurry along the days that slowly,
			<a class="pagenum" id="page22" title="22"> </a>out of the rest of heaven, move their stillness
			across this little world. The more we hurry,
			the more we read. Night and noon and morning
			the panorama passes before our eyes. By
			tables, on cars, and in the street we see them—readers,
			readers everywhere, drinking their
			blindness in. Life is a blur of printed paper.
			We see no more the things themselves. We
			see about them. We lose the power to see
			the things themselves. We see in sentences.
			The linotype looks for us. We know the
			world in columns. The sounds of the street
			are muffled to us. In papers up to our ears,
			we whirl along our endless tracks. The faces
			that pass are phantoms. In our little woodcut
			head-line dream we go ceaseless on, turning
			leaves,—days and weeks and months of leaves,—wherever
			we go—years of leaves. Boys who
			never have seen the sky above them, young
			men who have never seen it in a face, old men
			who have never looked out at sea across a
			crowd, nor guessed the horizons there—dead
			men, the flicker of life in their hands, not yet
			beneath the roofs of graves—all turning
			leaves.”</p>

			<p>The Mysterious Person stopped. Nobody
			said anything. It is the better way, generally,
			with The Mysterious Person. We were beginning
			to feel as if he were through, when his
			eye fell on a copy of The ——, lying on the
			floor. It was open at an unlucky page.</p>

			<p>“Look at that!” said he. He handed the
			<a class="pagenum" id="page23" title="23"> </a>paper to The P. G. S. of M., pointing with his
			finger, rather excitedly. The P. G. S. of M.
			looked at it—read it through. Then he put it
			down; The Mysterious Person went on.</p>

			<p>“Do you not know what it means when you,
			a civilised, cultivated, converted human being,
			can stand face to face with a list—a list like
			that—a list headed ‘<span class="small_all_caps">BOOKS OF THE WEEK</span>’—when,
			unblinking and shameless, and without
			a cry of protest, you actually read it through,
			without seeing, or seeming to see, for a single
			moment that right there—right there in that
			list—the fact that there is such a list—your
			civilisation is on trial for its life—that any
			society or nation or century that is shallow
			enough to publish as many books as that has
			yet to face the most awful, the most unprecedented,
			the most headlong-coming crisis in
			the history of the human race?”</p>

			<p>The Mysterious Person made a pause—the
			pause of settling things. [There are people
			who seem to think that the only really adequate
			way to settle a thing, in this world, is
			for them to ask a question about it.]</p>

			<p>At all events The Mysterious Person having
			asked a question at this point, everybody
			might as well have the benefit of it.</p>

			<p>In the meantime, it is to be hoped that in
			the next chapter The Presiding Genius of the
			State of Massachusetts, or somebody—will get
			a word in.</p>

				Parenthesis
				To the Gentle Reader</h4>

			<p>This was a footnote at first. It is placed at
			the top of the page in the hope that it will
			point at itself more and let the worst out at
			once. I want to say I—a little—in this
			book.</p>

			<p>I do not propose to do it very often. Indeed
			I am not sure just now, that I shall be able to
			do it at all, but I would like to have the feeling
			as I go along that arrangements have been
			made for it, and that it is all understood, and
			that if I am fairly good about it—ring a little
			bell or something—and warn people, I am
			going to be allowed—right here in my own
			book at least—to say I when I want to.</p>

			<p>I is the way I feel on the inside about this
			subject. Anybody can see it. And I want to
			be honest, in the first place, and in the second
			place (like a good many other people) I never
			have had what could be called a real good
			chance to say I in this world, and I feel that
			if I had—somehow, it would cure me.</p>

			<p>I have tried other ways. I have tried calling
			myself he. I have stated my experiences
			in principles—called myself it, and in the first
			part of this book I have already fallen into the
			way—page after page—of borrowing other
			people, when all the time I knew perfectly well
			<a class="pagenum" id="page25" title="25"> </a>(and everybody) that I preferred myself. At all
			events this calling one’s self names—now one
			and now another,—working one’s way <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">incognito</em>,
			all the way through one’s own book, is
			not making me as modest as I had hoped.
			There seems to be nothing for it—with some
			of us, but to work through to modesty the
			other way—backward—I it out.</p>

			<p>There is one other reason. This Mysterious
			Person I have arranged with in these opening
			chapters, to say I for me, does not seem to me
			to be doing it very well. I think any one—any
			fairly observing person—would admit that I
			could do it better, and if it’s going to be done
			at all, why should a mere spiritual machine—a
			kind of moral phonograph like this Mysterious
			Person—be put forward to take the ignominy
			of it? I have set my “I” up before me and
			duly cross-examined it. I have said to it,
			“Either you are good enough to say I in a
			book or you are not,” and my “I” has replied
			to me, “If I am not, I want everybody to know
			why and if I <span class="keep_together">am—am——.”</span> Well of course he
			is not, and we will all help him to know why.
			We will do as we would be done by. If there
			is ever going to be any possible comfort in this
			world for me, in not being what I ought to be,
			it is the thought that I am not the only one that
			knows it. At all events, this feeling that the
			worst is known, even if one takes, as I am
			doing now, a planet for a confessional, gives
			one a luxurious sense—a sense of combined
			<a class="pagenum" id="page26" title="26"> </a>safety and irresponsibility which would not be
			exchanged for a world.
			Every book should have I-places in it—breathing-holes—places
			where one’s soul can
			come up to the surface and look out through
			the ice and say things. I do not wish to seem
			superior and I will admit that I am as respectable
			as anybody in most places, but I do think
			that if half the time I am devoting, and am
			going to devote, to appearing as modest as
			people expect in this world, could be devoted
			to really doing something in it, my little
			modesty—such as it is—would not be missed.
			At all events I am persuaded that anything—almost
			anything—would be better than this
			eternal keeping up appearances of all being a
			little less interested in ourselves than we are,
			which is what Literature and Society are for,
			mostly. We all do it, more or less. And yet
			if there were only a few scattered-along places,
			public soul-open places to rest in, and be honest
			in—(in art-parlours and teas and things)—wouldn’t
			we see people rushing to them? I
			would give the world sometimes to believe that
			it would pay to be as honest with some people
			as with a piece of paper or with a book.</p>

			<p>I dare say I am all wrong in striking out and
			flourishing about in a chapter like this, and in
			threatening to have more like them, but there
			is one comfort I lay to my soul in doing it. If
			there is one thing rather than another a book
			is for (one’s own book) it is, that it furnishes
			<a class="pagenum" id="page27" title="27"> </a>the one good, fair, safe place for a man to talk
			about himself in, because it is the only place
			that any one—absolutely any one,—at any moment,
			can shut him up.</p>

			<p>This is not saying that I am going to do it.
			My courage will go from me (for saying I, I
			mean). Or I shall not be humble enough or
			something and it all will pass away. I am
			going to do it now, a little, but I cannot guarantee
			it. All of a sudden, no telling when or
			why, I shall feel that Mysterious Person with
			all his worldly trappings hanging around me
			again and before I know it, before you know
			it, Gentle Reader, I with all my I (or i) shall
			be swallowed up. Next time I appear, you
			shall see me, decorous, trim, and in the third
			person, my literary white tie on, snooping
			along through these sentences one after the
			other, crossing my I’s out, wishing I had never
			been born.</p>

			<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

			<p class="post_thoughtbreak">Postscript. I cannot help recording at this
			point, for the benefit of reckless persons, how
			saying I in a book feels. It feels a good deal
			like a very small boy in a very high swing—a
			kind of flashing-of-everything through-nothing
			feeling, but it cannot be undone now,
			and so if you please, Gentle Reader, and if
			everybody will hold their breath, I am going
			to hold on tight and do it.</p>

				More Parenthesis—But More to
				the Point</h4>

			<p>I have gotten into a way lately, while I am
			just living along, of going out and taking a
			good square turn every now and then, in front
			of myself. It is not altogether an agreeable
			experience, but there seems to be a window in
			every man’s nature on purpose for it—arranged
			and located on purpose for it, and I find on the
			whole that going out around one’s window,
			once in so often, and standing awhile has
			advantages. The general idea is to stand
			perfectly still for a little time, in a kind of
			general, public, disinterested way, and then
			suddenly, when one is off one’s guard and not
			looking, so to speak, take a peek backwards
			into one’s self.</p>

			<p>I am aware that it does not follow, because I
			have just come out and have been looking into
			my window, that I have a right to hold up any
			person or persons who may be going by in
			this book, and ask them to look in too, but at
			the same time I cannot conceal—do not wish
			to conceal, even if I could—that there have
			been times, standing in front of my window
			and looking in, when what I have seen there
			has seemed to me to assume a national significance.</p>

			<p>There are millions of other windows like it.
			<a class="pagenum" id="page29" title="29"> </a>It is one of the daily sorrows of my life that the
			people who own them do not seem to know it—most
			of them—except perhaps in a vague,
			hurried pained way. Sometimes I feel like
			calling out to them as I stand by my window—see
			them go hurrying by on The Great Street:
			“Say there, Stranger! Halloa, Stranger!
			Want to see yourself? Come right over here
			and look at me!”</p>

			<p>Nobody believes it, of course. It’s a good
			deal like standing and waving one’s arms in
			the Midway—being an egotist,—but I must say,
			I have never got a man yet—got him in out of
			the rush, I mean, right up in front of my window—got
			him once stooped down and really
			looking in there, but he admitted there was
			something in it.</p>

			<p>Thus does it come to pass—this gentle swelling.
			Let me be a warning to you, Gentle
			Reader, when you once get to philosophising
			yourself over (along the line of your faults)
			into the disputed territory of the First Person
			Singular. I am not asking you to try to believe
			my little philosophy of types. I am trying
			to, in my humble way, to be sure, but I
			would rather, on the whole, let it go. It is
			not so much my philosophy I rest my case
			on, as my sub-philosophy or religion—viz., I
			like it and believe in it—saying I. (Thank
			Heaven that, bad as it is, I have struck bottom
			at last!) The best I can do under the circumstances,
			I suppose, is to beg (in a perfectly
			<a class="pagenum" id="page30" title="30"> </a>blank way) forgiveness—forgiveness of any and
			every kind from everybody, if in this and the
			following chapters I fall sometimes to talking
			of people—people at large—under the general
			head of myself.</p>

			<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

			<p class="post_thoughtbreak">I was born to read. I spent all my early
			years, as I remember them, with books,—peering
			softly about in them. My whole being
			was hushed and trustful and expectant at the
			sight of a printed page. I lived in the presence
			of books, with all my thoughts lying open
			about me; a kind of still, radiant mood of welcome
			seemed to lie upon them. When I
			looked at a shelf of books I felt the whole
			world flocking to me.</p>

			<p>I have been civilised now, I should say,
			twenty, or possibly twenty-five, years. At
			least every one supposes I am civilised, and
			my whole being has changed. I cannot so
			much as look upon a great many books in a
			library or any other heaped-up place, without
			feeling bleak and heartless. I never read if I
			can help it. My whole attitude toward current
			literature is grouty and snappish, a kind of
			perpetual interrupted “What are you ringing
			my door-bell now for?” attitude. I am a
			disagreeable character. I spend at least one
			half my time, I should judge, keeping things
			off, in defending my character. Then I spend
			the other half in wondering if, after all, it was
			worth it. What I see in my window has
			<a class="pagenum" id="page31" title="31"> </a>changed. When I used to go out around and
			look into it, in the old days, to see what I was
			like, I was a sunny, open valley—streams and
			roads and everything running down into it,
			and opening out of it, and when I go out suddenly
			now, and turn around in front of myself
			and look in—I am a mountain pass. I sift
			my friends—up a trail. The few friends that
			come, come a little out of breath (God bless
			them!), and a book cannot so much as get to
			me except on a mule’s back.</p>

			<p>It is by no means an ideal arrangement—a
			mountain pass, but it is better than always
			sitting in one’s study in civilisation, where
			every passer-by, pamphlet, boy in the street,
			thinks he might just as well come up and ring
			one’s door-bell awhile. All modern books are
			book agents at heart, around getting subscriptions
			for themselves. If a man wants to be
			sociable or literary nowadays, he can only do
			it by being a more or less disagreeable character,
			and if he wishes to be a beautiful character,
			he must go off and do it by himself.</p>

			<p>This is a mere choice in suicides.</p>

			<p>The question that presses upon me is: Whose
			fault is it that a poor wistful, incomplete, human
			being, born into this huge dilemma of a
			world, can only keep on having a soul in it, by
			keeping it (that is, his soul) tossed back and
			forth—now in one place where souls are lost,
			and now in another? Is it your fault, or mine,
			Gentle Reader, that we are obliged to live in
			<a class="pagenum" id="page32" title="32"> </a>this undignified, obstreperous fashion in what is
			called civilisation? I cannot believe it. Nearly
			all the best people one knows can be seen sitting
			in civilisation on the edge of their chairs, or
			hurrying along with their souls in satchels.</p>

			<p>There is but one conclusion. Civilisation is
			not what it is advertised to be. Every time I
			see a fresh missionary down at the steamer
			wharf, as I do sometimes, starting away for
			other lands, loaded up with our Institutions to
			the eyes, Church in one hand and Schoolhouse
			in the other, trim, happy, and smiling over
			them, at everybody, I feel like stepping up to
			him and saying, what seem to me, a few appropriate
			words. I seldom do it, but the other
			day when I happened to be down at the <i>Umbria</i>
			dock about sailing-time, I came across one (a
			foreign missionary, I mean) pleasant, thoughtless,
			and benevolent-looking, standing there all
			by himself by the steamer-rail, and I thought
			I would try speaking to him.</p>

			<p>“Where are you going to be putting—those?”
			I said, pointing to a lot of funny little
			churches and funny little schoolhouses he was
			holding in both hands.</p>

			<p>“From Greenland’s icy mountains to India’s
			coral strand,” he said.</p>

			<p>I looked at them a minute. “You don’t
			think, do you?” I said—“You don’t really
			think you had better wait over a little—bring
			them back and let us—finish them for you, do
			you? one or two—samples?” I said.</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page33" title="33"> </a>He looked at me with what seemed to me at
			first, a kind of blurred, helpless look. I soon
			saw that he was pitying me and I promptly
			stepped down to the dining-saloon and tried to
			appreciate two or three tons of flowers.</p>

			<p>I do not wish to say a word against missionaries.
			They are merely apt to be somewhat
			heedless, morally-hurried persons, rushing
			about the world turning people (as they think)
			right side up everywhere, without really noticing
			them much, but I do think that a great
			deliberate corporate body like The American
			Board of Commissioners of Foreign Missions
			ought to be more optimistic about the Church—wait
			and work for it a little more, expect a
			little more of it.</p>

			<p>It seems to me that it ought to be far less
			pessimistic than it is, also, about what we can
			do in the way of schools and social life in
			civilisation and about civilisation’s way of
			doing business. Is our little knack of Christianity
			(I find myself wondering) quite worthy
			of all this attention it is getting from The
			American Board of Commissioners of Foreign
			Missions? Why should it approve of civilisation
			with a rush? Does any one really suppose
			that it is really time to pat it on the back—yet?—to
			spend a million dollars a year—patting it
			on the back?</p>

			<p>I merely throw out the question.</p>

			More Literary Rush</h4>

			<p>We had been talking along, in our Club, as
			usual, for some time, on the general subject of
			the world—fixing the blame for things. We
			had come to the point where it was nearly all
			fixed (most of it on other people) when I
			thought I might as well put forward my little
			theory that nearly everything that was the
			matter, could be traced to the people who
			“belong to Society.”</p>

			<p>Then The P. G. S. of M. (who is always
			shoving a dictionary around in front of him
			when he talks) spoke up and said:</p>

			<p>“But who belongs to Society?”</p>

			<p>“All persons who read what they are told to
			and who call where they can’t help it. What
			this world needs just now,” I went on, looking
			The P. G. S. of M. as much in the eye as I
			could, “is emancipation. It needs a prophet—a
			man who can gather about him a few
			brave-hearted, intelligently ignorant men, who
			shall go about with their beautiful feet on the
			mountains, telling the good tidings of how
			many things there are we do not need to know.
			The prejudice against being ignorant is largely
			because people have not learned how to do it.
			The wrong people have taken hold of it.”</p>

			<p>I cannot remember the exact words of what
			was said after this, but I said that it seemed to me
			<a class="pagenum" id="page35" title="35"> </a>that most people were afraid not to know everything.
			Not knowing too much is a natural
			gift, and unless a man can make his ignorance
			contagious—inspire people with the books he
			dares not read—of course the only thing he
			can do is to give up and read everything, and
			belong to Society. He certainly cannot belong
			to himself unless he protects himself with well-selected,
			carefully guarded, daring ignorance.
			Think of the books—the books that are dictated
			to us—the books that will not let a man
			go,—and behind every book a hundred intelligent
			men and women—one’s friends, too—one’s
			own <span class="keep_together">kin——</span></p>

			<p>P. G. S. of M.: “But the cultured man
			<span class="keep_together">must——”</span></p>

			<p>The cultured man is the man who can tell
			me what he does not know, with such grace
			that I feel ashamed of knowing it.</p>

			<p>Now there’s <span class="keep_together">M——,</span> for example. Other
			people seem to read to talk, but I never see
			him across a drawing-room without an impulse
			of barbarism, and I always get him off into a
			corner as soon as I can, if only to rest myself—to
			feel that I have a right not to read everything.
			He always proves to me something
			that I can get along without. He is full of the
			most choice and picturesque bits of ignorance.
			He is creatively ignorant. He displaces a
			book every time I see him—which is a deal
			better in these days than writing one. A
			man should be measured by his book-displacement.
			<a class="pagenum" id="page36" title="36"> </a>He goes about with his thinking face,
			and a kind of nimbus over him, of never needing
			to read at all. He has nothing whatever
			to give but himself, but I had rather have one
			of his <em>questions</em> about a book I had read, than
			all the other opinions and subtle distinctions
			in the room—or the book itself.</p>

			<p>P. G. S. of M. “But the cultured man
			<span class="keep_together">must——”</span></p>

			<p><strong>NOT.</strong> It is the very essence of a cultured
			man that when he hears the word “must” it
			is on his own lips. It is the very essence of
			his culture that he says it to himself. His
			culture is his belonging to himself, and his belonging
			to himself is the first condition of his
			being worth giving to other people. One longs
			for Elia. People know too much, and there
			doesn’t seem to be a man living who can
			charm them from the error of their way.
			Knowledge takes the place of everything else,
			and all one can do in this present day as he
			reads the reviews and goes to his club, is to
			look forward with a tired heart to the prophecy
			of Scripture, “Knowledge shall pass away.”</p>

			<p>Where do we see the old and sweet content
			of loving a thing for itself? Now, there are
			the flowers. The only way to delight in a
			flower at your feet in these days is to watch
			with it all alone, or keep still about it. The
			moment you speak of it, it becomes botany.
			It’s a rare man who will not tell you all he
			knows about it. Love isn’t worth anything
			<a class="pagenum" id="page37" title="37"> </a>without a classic name. It’s a wonder we
			have any flowers left. Half the charm of a
			flower to me is that it looks demure and talks
			perfume and keeps its name so gently to itself.
			The man who always enjoys views by picking
			out the places he knows, is a symbol of all
			our reading habits and of our national relation
			to books. One can glory in a great cliff down
			in the depths of his heart, but if you mention
			it, it is geology, and an argument. Even the
			birds sing zoölogically, and as for the sky, it
			has become a mere blue-and-gold science, and
			all the wonder seems to be confined to one’s
			not knowing the names of the planets. I was
			brought up wistfully on</p>

			<div class="poem">
				<p>Twinkle, twinkle, little star,</p>
				<p>How I wonder what you are.</p>
			</div>

			<p class="continued_paragraph">But now it is become:</p>


			<div class="poem">
				<p>Twinkle, twinkle, little star,</p>
				<p>Teacher’s told me what you are.</p>
			</div>

			<p>Even babies won’t wonder very soon. That
			is to say, they won’t wonder out loud. Nobody
			does. Another of my poems was:</p>

			<div class="poem">
				<p>Where did you come from, baby dear?</p>
				<p>Out of the everywhere into here.</p>
			</div>

			<p>I thought of it the other day when I stepped

			<a class="pagenum" id="page38" title="38"> </a>Thursday Afternoon, I felt like a literary

			<p class="continued_paragraph">And the bookcases stared at me.</p>

			<p>It is a serious question whether the average
			American youth is ever given a chance to thirst
			for knowledge. He thirsts for ignorance instead.
			From the very first he is hemmed in
			by knowledge. The kindergarten with its
			suave relentlessness, its perfunctory cheerfulness,
			closes in upon the life of every child with
			himself. The dear old-fashioned breathing
			spell he used to have after getting here—whither
			has it gone? The rough, strong, ruthless,
			unseemly, grown-up world crowds to the
			very edge of every beginning life. It has no
			patience with trailing clouds of glory. Flocks
			of infants every year—new-comers to this planet—who
			can but watch them sadly, huddled
			closer and closer to the little strip of wonder
			that is left near the land from which they
			came? No lingering away from us. No infinite
			holiday. Childhood walks a precipice
			crowded to the brink of birth. We tabulate its
			moods. We register its learning inch by inch.
			We draw its poor little premature soul out of
			its body breath by breath. Infants are well
			informed now. The suckling has nerves. A
			few days more he will be like all the rest of
			us. It will be:</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page39" title="39"> </a>Poem: “When I Was Weaned.”</p>

			<p>“My First Tooth: A Study.”</p>

			<p>The Presiding Genius of the State of Massachusetts,
			with his dazed, kind look, looked up
			and said: “I fear, my dear fellow, there is no
			place for you in the world.”</p>

			<p>Thanks. One of the delights of going fishing
			or hunting is, that one learns how small
			“a place in the world” is—comes across so
			many accidentally preserved characters—preserved
			by not having a place in the world—persons
			that are interesting to be with—persons
			you can tell things.</p>

			<p>The real object—it seems to me—in meeting
			another human being is complement—fitting
			into each other’s ignorances. Sometimes it
			seems as if it were only where there is something
			to be caught or shot, or where there is
			plenty of room, that the highest and most
			sociable and useful forms of ignorance were
			allowed to mature.</p>

			<p>One can still find such fascinating prejudices,
			such frank enthusiasms of ignorance, where
			there’s good fishing; and then, in the stray
			hamlets, there is the grave whimsicalness and
			the calm superior air of austerity to cultured
			people.</p>

			<p>Ah, let me live in the Maine woods or wander
			by the brooks of Virginia, and rest my
			soul in the delights—in the pomposity—of
			ignorance—ignorance in its pride and glory
			and courage and lovableness! I never come
			<a class="pagenum" id="page40" title="40"> </a>back from a vacation without a dream of what
			I might have been, if I had only dared to know
			a little less; and even now I sometimes feel I
			have ignorance enough, if like Elia, for instance,
			I only knew how to use it, but I cannot
			as much as get over being ashamed of it. I
			am nearly gone. I have little left but the gift
			of being bored. That is something—but
			hardly a day passes without my slurring over
			a guilty place in conversation, without my
			hiding my ignorance under a bushel, where I
			can go later and take a look at it by myself.
			Then I know all about it next time and sink
			lower and lower. A man can do nothing
			alone. Of course, ignorance must be natural
			and not acquired in order to have the true ring
			and afford the most relief in the world; but
			every wide-awake village that has thoughtful
			people enough—people who are educated up to
			it—ought to organise an Ignoramus Club to
			defend the town from papers and <span class="keep_together">books——.</span></p>

			<p>It was at about this point that The Presiding
			Genius of the State of Massachusetts took
			up the subject, and after modulating a little
			and then modulating a little more, he was soon
			listening to himself about a book we had not
			read, and I sat in my chair and wrote out this.</p>

			<p class="post_thoughtbreak">I have sometimes thought I would like to go
			off to some great, wide, bare, splendid place—nothing
			but Time and Room in it—and read
			awhile. I would want it built in the same
			general style and with the same general effect
			as the universe, but a universe in which everything
			lets one alone, in which everything just
			goes quietly on in its great still round, letting
			itself be looked at—no more said about it,
			nothing to be done about it. No exclamations
			required. No one standing around explaining
			things or showing how they appreciated them.</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page44" title="44"> </a>Then after I had looked about a little, seen
			that everything was safe and according to
			specifications, I think the first thing I would
			do would be to sit down and see if I could not
			read a great book—the way I used to read a
			great book, before I belonged to civilisation,
			read it until I felt my soul growing softly
			toward it, reaching up to the day and to the
			night with it.</p>

			<p>I have always kept on hoping that I would
			be allowed, in spite of being somewhat mixed
			up with civilisation, to be a normal man sometime.
			It has always seemed to me that the
			normal man—the highly organised man in all
			ages, is the man who takes the universe primarily
			as a spectacle. This is his main use for
			it. The object of his life is to get a good look
			at it before he dies—to be the kind of man who
			can get a good look at it. How any one can
			go through a whole life—sixty or seventy years
			of it—with a splendour like this arching over
			him morning, noon, and night, flying beneath
			his feet, blooming out at him on every side,
			and not spend nearly all his time (after the
			bare necessaries of life) in taking it in, listening
			and tasting and looking in it, is one of the
			seven wonders of the world. I never look out
			of my factory window in civilisation, see a
			sunset or shore of the universe,—am reminded
			again that there is a universe—but I wonder
			at myself and wonder at It. I try to put
			civilisation and the universe together. I cannot
			<a class="pagenum" id="page45" title="45"> </a>do it. It’s as if we were afraid to be caught
			looking at it—most of us—spending the time
			to look at it, or as if we were ashamed before
			the universe itself—running furiously to and
			fro in it, lest it should look at us.</p>

			<p>It is the first trait of a great book, it seems
			to me, that it makes all other books—little
			hurrying, petulant books—wait. A kind of
			immeasurable elemental hunger comes to a
			man out of it. Somehow I feel I have not had
			it out with a great book if I have not faced
			other great things with it. I want to face storms
			with it, hours of weariness and miles of walking
			with it. It seems to ask me to. It seems
			to bring with it something which makes me
			want to stop my mere reading-and-doing kind
			of life, my ink-and-paper imitation kind of life,
			and come out and be a companion with the
			silent shining, with the eternal going on of
			things. It seems to be written in every
			writing that is worth a man’s while that it
			can not—that it shall not—be read by itself.
			It is written that a man shall work to read, that
			he must win some great delight to do his reading
			with. Many and many a winter day I
			have tramped with four lines down to the edge
			of the night, to overtake my soul—to read
			four lines with. I have faced a wind for
			hours—been bitterly cold with it—before the
			utmost joy of the book I had lost would come
			back to me. I find that when I am being
			normal (vacations mostly) I scarcely know
			<a class="pagenum" id="page46" title="46"> </a>what it is to give myself over to another mind
			for more than an hour or so at a time. If a
			chapter has anything in it, I want to do something
			with it, go out and believe it, live with
			it, exercise it awhile. I am not only bored
			with a book when it does not interest me. I
			am bored with it when it does. I want to
			interrupt it, take it outdoors, see what the
			hills and clouds think, try it on, test it, see if
			it is good enough—see if it can come down
			upon me as rain or sunlight or other real
			things and blow upon me as the wind. It
			does not belong to me until it has found its
			way through all the weathers within and the
			weathers without, until it drifts with me
			through moods, events, sensations, and days
			and nights, faces and sunsets, and the light of
			stars,—until it is a part of life itself. I find
			there is no other or shorter or easier way for
			me to do with a great book than to greet it as
			it seems to ask to be greeted, as if it were a
			world that had come to me and sought me out—wanted
			me to live in it. Hundreds and hundreds
			of times, when I am being civilised,
			have I not tried to do otherwise? Have I not
			stopped my poor pale, hurried, busy soul (like
			a kind of spectre flying past me) before a great
			book and tried to get it to speak to it, and it
			would not? It requires a world—a great book
			does—as a kind of ticket of admission, and
			what have I to do, when I am being civilised,
			with a world—the one that’s running still
			<a class="pagenum" id="page47" title="47"> </a>and godlike over me? Do I not for days and
			weeks at a time go about in it, guilty, shut-in,
			and foolish under it, slinking about—its emptied
			miracles all around me, mean, joyless, anxious,
			unable to look the littlest flower in the face—unable——. “Ah,
			God!” my soul cries out
			within me. Are not all these things mine?
			Do they not belong with me and I with them?
			And I go racing about, making things up in
			their presence, plodding for shadows, cutting
			out paper dolls to live with. All the time this
			earnest, splendid, wasted heaven shining over
			me—doing nothing with it, expecting nothing
			of it—a little more warmth out of it perhaps,
			a little more light not to see in——. Who am I
			that the grasses should whisper to me, that the
			winds should blow upon me? Now and then
			there are days that come, when I see a flower—when
			I really see a flower—and my soul cries
			out to it.</p>

			<p>Now and then there are days too, when I
			see a great book, a book that has the universe
			wrought in it. I find my soul feeling it vaguely,
			creeping toward it. I wonder if I dare to read
			it. I remember how I used to read it. I all
			but pray to it. I sit in my factory window and
			try sometimes. But it is all far away—at least
			as long as I stay in my window. It’s all about
			some one else—a kind of splendid wistful walking
			in a dream. It does not really belong to
			me to live in a great book—a book with the
			universe in it. Sometimes it almost seems to.
			<a class="pagenum" id="page48" title="48"> </a>But it barely, faintly belongs to me. It is as
			if the sky came to me, and stooped down over
			me, and then went softly away in my sleep.</p>

			The Dead Level of Intelligence</h4>

			<p>Your hostess introduces you to a man in a
			drawing-room. “Mr. <span class="keep_together">C——</span> belongs to a
			Browning Club, too,” she says.</p>

			<p>What are you going to do about it? Are
			you going to talk about Browning?</p>

			<p>Not if Browning is one of your alive places.
			You will reconnoitre first—James Whitcomb
			Riley or Ella Wheeler Wilcox. There is no
			telling where The Enemy will bring you up, if
			you do not. He may tell you something about
			Browning you never knew—something you
			have always wanted to know,—but you will
			be hurt that he knew it. He may be the
			original Grammarian of “The Grammarian’s
			Funeral” (whom Robert Browning took—and
			knew perfectly well that he took at the one
			poetic moment of his life), but his belonging to
			a Browning Club—The Enemy, that is—does
			not mean anything to you or to any one else
			nowadays—either about Browning or about
			himself.</p>

			<p>There was a time once, when, if a man
			revealed in conversation, that he was familiar
			with poetic structure in John Keats, it meant
			<a class="pagenum" id="page49" title="49"> </a>something about the man—his temperament,
			his producing or delighting power. It means
			now, that he has taken a course in poetics in
			college, or teaches English in a high school,
			and is carrying deadly information about with
			him wherever he goes. It does not mean that
			he has a spark of the Keats spirit in him, or
			that he could have endured being in the same
			room with Keats, or Keats could have endured
			being in the same room with him, for fifteen
			minutes.</p>

			<p>If there is one inconvenience rather than
			another in being born in the latter half of the
			nineteenth century, it is the almost constant
			compulsion one is under in it, of finding people
			out—making a distinction between the people
			who know a beautiful thing and are worth
			while, and the boors of culture—the people who
			know all about it. One sees on every hand
			to-day persons occupying positions of importance
			who have been taken through all
			the motions of education, from the bottom to
			the top, but who always belong to the intellectual
			lower classes whatever their positions
			may be, because they are not masters. They
			are clumsy and futile with knowledge. Their
			culture has not been made over into them—selves.
			They have acquired it largely under
			mob-influence (the dead level of intelligence),
			and all that they can do with it, not wanting
			it, is to be teachery with it—force it on other
			people who do not want it.</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page50" title="50"> </a>Whether in the origin, processes, or results
			of their learning, these people have all the
			attributes of a mob. Their influence and force
			in civilisation is a mob influence, and it operates
			in the old and classic fashion of mobs upon all
			who oppose it.</p>

			<p>It constitutes at present the most important
			and securely intrenched intimidating force that
			modern society presents against the actual
			culture of the world, whether in the schools or
			out of them. Its voice is in every street, and its
			shout of derision may be heard in almost every
			walk of life against all who refuse to conform
			to it. There are but very few who refuse.
			Millions of human beings, young and old, in
			meek and willing rows are seen on every side,
			standing before It—<span class="small_all_caps">THE DEAD LEVEL</span>,—anxious
			to do anything to be graded up to it,
			or to be graded down to it—offering their heads
			to be taken off, their necks to be stretched, or
			their waists—willing to live footless all their
			days—anything—anything whatever, bless
			their hearts! to know that they are on the
			Level, the Dead Level, the precise and exact
			Dead Level of Intelligence.</p>

			<p>The fact that this mob-power keeps its hold
			by using books instead of bricks is merely a
			matter of form. It occupies most of the
			strategic positions just now in the highways
			of learning, and it does all the things that
			mobs do, and does them in the way that mobs
			do them. It has broken into the gardens, into
			<a class="pagenum" id="page51" title="51"> </a>the arts, the resting-places of nations, and with
			its factories to learn to love in, its treadmills
			to learn to sing in, it girdles its belt of drudgery
			around the world and carries bricks and mortar
			to the clouds. It shouts to every human being
			across the spaces—the outdoors of life: “Who
			goes there? Come thou with us. Dig thou
			with us. Root or die!”</p>

			<p>Every vagrant joy-maker and world-builder
			the modern era boasts—genius, lover, singer,
			artist, has had to have his struggle with the
			hod-carriers of culture, and if a lover of books
			has not enough love in him to refuse to be
			coerced into joining the huge Intimidator, the
			aggregation of the Reading Labour Unions
			of the world, which rules the world, there is
			little hope for him. All true books draw
			quietly away from him. Their spirit is a
			spirit he cannot know.</p>

			<p>It would be hard to find a more significant
			fact with regard to the ruling culture of
			modern life than the almost total displacement
			of temperament in it,—its blank, staring inexpressiveness.
			We have lived our lives so
			long under the domination of the “Cultured-man-must”
			theory of education—the industry
			of being well informed has gained such headway
			with us, that out of all of the crowds of
			the civilised we prefer to live with to-day, one
			must go very far to find a cultivated man who
			has not violated himself in his knowledge, who
			has not given up his last chance at distinction—his
			<a class="pagenum" id="page52" title="52"> </a>last chance to have his knowledge fit him
			closely and express him and belong to him.</p>

			<p>The time was, when knowledge was made to
			fit people like their clothes. But now that we
			have come to the point where we pride ourselves
			on educating people in rows and civilising
			them in the bulk, “If a man has the
			privilege of being born by himself, of beginning
			his life by himself, it is as much as he
			can expect,” says the typical Board of Education.
			The result is, so far as his being
			educated is concerned, the average man looks
			back to his first birthday as his last chance of
			being treated—as God made him,—a special
			creation by himself. “The Almighty may
			deal with a man, when He makes him, as a
			special creation by himself. He may manage
			to do it afterward. <em>We</em> cannot,” says The
			Board, succinctly, drawing its salary; “It increases
			the tax rate.”</p>

			<p>The problem is dealt with simply enough.
			There is just so much cloth to be had and just
			so many young and two-legged persons to be
			covered with it—and that is the end of it.
			The growing child walks down the years—turns
			every corner of life—with Vistas of
			Ready-Made Clothing hanging before him,
			closing behind him. Unless he shall fit himself
			to these clothes—he is given to understand—down
			the pitying, staring world he shall
			go, naked, all his days, like a dream in the
			night.</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page53" title="53"> </a>It is a general principle that a nation’s life
			can be said to be truly a civilised life, in proportion
			as it is expressive, and in proportion
			as all the persons in it, in the things they
			know and in the things they do, are engaged
			in expressing what they are.</p>

			<p>A generation may be said to stand forth in
			history, to be a great and memorable generation
			in art and letters, in material and spiritual
			creation, in proportion as the knowledge of
			that generation was fitted to the people who
			wore it and the things they were doing in it,
			and the things they were born todo.</p>

			<p>If it were not contradicted by almost every
			attribute of what is being called an age of
			special and general culture, it would seem to
			be the first axiom of all culture that knowledge
			can only be made to be true knowledge,
			by being made to fit people, and to express
			them as their clothes fit them and express
			them.</p>

			<p>But we do not want knowledge in our civilisation
			to fit people as their clothes fit them.
			We do not even want their clothes to fit them.
			The people themselves do not want it. Our
			modern life is an elaborate and organised endeavour,
			on the part of almost every person in
			it, to escape from being fitted, either in knowledge
			or in anything else. The first symptom
			of civilisation—of the fact that a man is becoming
			civilised—is that he wishes to appear
			to belong where he does not. It is looked
			<a class="pagenum" id="page54" title="54"> </a>upon as the spirit of the age. He wishes to be
			learned, that no one may find out how little
			he knows. He wishes to be religious, that no
			one may see how wicked he is. He wishes to
			be respectable, that no one may know that he
			does not respect himself. The result mocks
			at us from every corner in life. Society is a
			struggle to get into the wrong clothes. Culture
			is a struggle to learn the things that belong
			to some one else. Black Mollie (who is
			the cook next door) presented her betrothed
			last week—a stable hand on the farm—with an
			eight-dollar manicure set. She did not mean
			to sum up the condition of culture in the
			United States in this simple and tender act.
			But she did.</p>

			<p>Michael O’Hennessy, who lives under the
			hill, sums it up also. He has just bought a
			brougham in which he and Mrs. O’H. can be
			seen almost any pleasant Sunday driving in
			the Park. It is not to be denied that Michael
			O’Hennessy, sitting in his brougham, is a
			genuinely happy-looking object. But it is not
			the brougham itself that Michael enjoys.
			What he enjoys is the fact that he has bought
			the brougham, and that the brougham belongs
			to some one else. Mrs. John Brown-Smith,
			who presides at our tubs from week to week,
			and who comes to us in a brilliant silk waist
			(removed for business), has just bought a
			piano to play <cite>Hold the Fort</cite> on, with one finger,
			when the neighbours are passing by—a fact
			<a class="pagenum" id="page55" title="55"> </a>which is not without national significance,
			which sheds light upon schools and upon
			college catalogues and learning-shows, and
			upon educational conditions through the whole
			United States.</p>

			<p>It would be a great pity if a man could not
			know the things that have always belonged
			before, to other men to know, and it is the
			essence of culture that he should, but his appearing
			to know things that belong to some one
			else—his desire to appear to know them—heaps
			up darkness. The more things there
			are a man knows without knowing the inside
			of them—the spirit of them—the more kinds
			of an ignoramus he is. It is not enough to say
			that the learned man (learned in this way) is
			merely ignorant. His ignorance is placed
			where it counts the most,—generally,—at the
			fountain heads of society, and he radiates
			ignorance.</p>

			<p>There seem to be three objections to the
			Dead Level of Intelligence,—getting people at
			all hazards, alive or dead, to know certain
			things. First, the things that a person who
			learns in this way appears to know, are blighted
			by his appearing to know them. Second, he
			keeps other people who might know them from
			wanting to. Third, he poisons his own life,
			by appearing to know—by even desiring to
			appear to know—what is not in him to know.
			He takes away the last hope he can ever have
			of really knowing the thing he appears to
			<a class="pagenum" id="page56" title="56"> </a>know, and, unless he is careful, the last hope
			he can ever have of really knowing anything.
			He destroys the thing a man does his knowing
			with. It is not the least pathetic phase of the
			great industry of being well informed, that
			thousands of men and women may be seen on
			every hand, giving up their lives that they
			may appear to live, and giving up knowledge
			that they may appear to know, taking pains for
			vacuums. Success in appearing to know is success
			in locking one’s self outside of knowledge,
			and all that can be said of the most learned
			man that lives—if he is learned in this way—is
			that he knows more things that he does not
			know, about more things, than any man in the
			world. He runs the gamut of ignorance.</p>

			<p>In the meantime, as long as the industry of
			being well informed is the main ideal of living
			in the world, as long as every man’s life,
			chasing the shadow of some other man’s life,
			goes hurrying by, grasping at ignorance, there
			is nothing we can do—most of us—as educators,
			but to rescue a youth now and then from
			the rush and wait for results, both good and
			evil, to work themselves out. Those of us who
			respect every man’s life, and delight in it and
			in the dignity of the things that belong to it,
			would like to do many things. We should be
			particularly glad to join hands in the “practical”
			things that are being hurried into the
			hurry around us. But they do not seem to us
			practical. The only practical thing we know
			<a class="pagenum" id="page57" title="57"> </a>of that can be done with a man who does not
			respect himself, is to get him to. It is true,
			no doubt, that we cannot respect another man’s
			life for him, but we are profoundly convinced
			that we cannot do anything more practical for
			such a man’s life than respecting it until he
			respects it himself, and we are convinced also
			that until he does respect it himself, respecting
			it for him is the only thing that any one else
			can do—the beginning and end of all action for
			him and of all knowledge. Democracy to-day
			in education—as in everything else—is facing
			its supreme opportunity. Going about in the
			world respecting men until they respect themselves
			is almost the only practical way there is
			of serving them.</p>

			<p>We find it necessary to believe that any man
			in this present day who shall be inspired to respect
			his life, who shall refuse to take to himself
			the things that do not belong to his life,
			who shall break with the appearance of things,
			who shall rejoice in the things that are really
			real to him—there shall be no withstanding
			him. The strength of the universe shall be in
			him. He shall be glorious with it. The man
			who lives down through the knowledge that
			he has, has all the secret of all knowledge that he
			does not have. The spirit that all truths are
			known with, becomes his spirit. The essential
			mastery over all real things and over all
			real men is his possession forever.</p>

			<p>When this vital and delighted knowledge—knowledge
			<a class="pagenum" id="page58" title="58"> </a>that is based on facts—one’s own
			self-respecting experience with facts, shall begin
			again to be the habit of the educated life,
			the days of the Dead Level of Intelligence
			shall be numbered. Men are going to be the
			embodiment of the truths they know—some-time—as
			they have been in the past. When
			the world is filled once more with men who
			know what they know, learning will cease to
			be a theory about a theory of life, and children
			will acquire truths as helplessly and inescapably
			as they acquire parents. Truths will be
			learned through the types of men the truths
			have made. A man was meant to learn truths
			by gazing up and down lives—out of his own
			life.</p>

			<p>When these principles are brought home to
			educators—when they are practised in some
			degree by the people, instead of merely, as
			they have always been before, by the leaders
			of the people, the world of knowledge shall be
			a new world. All knowledge shall be human,
			incarnate, expressive, artistic. Whole systems
			of knowledge shall come to us by seeing one
			another’s faces on the street.</p>

			The Art of Reading as One Likes</h4>

			<p>Most of us are apt to discover by the time we
			are too old to get over it, that we are born with
			<a class="pagenum" id="page59" title="59"> </a>a natural gift for being interested in ourselves.
			We realise in a general way, that our lives are
			not very important—that they are being lived
			on a comparatively obscure but comfortable
			little planet, on a side street in space—but no
			matter how much we study astronomy, nor
			how fully we are made to feel how many other
			worlds there are for people to live on, and
			how many other people have lived on this one,
			we are still interested in ourselves.</p>

			<p>The fact that the universe is very large is
			neither here nor there to us, in a certain sense.
			It is a mere matter of size. A man has to live
			on it. If he had to live on all of it, it would
			be different. It naturally comes to pass that
			when a human being once discovers that he is
			born in a universe like this, his first business
			in it is to find out the relation of the nearest,
			most sympathetic part of it to himself.</p>

			<p>After the usual first successful experiment a
			child makes in making connection with the
			universe, the next thing he learns is how much
			of the universe there is that is not good to eat.
			He does not quite understand it at first—the
			unswallowableness of things. He soon comes
			to the conclusion that, although it is worth
			while as a general principle, in dealing with
			a universe, to try to make the connection, as
			a rule, with one’s mouth, it cannot be expected
			to succeed except part of the time. He
			looks for another connection. He learns that
			some things in this world are merely made to
			<a class="pagenum" id="page60" title="60"> </a>feel, and drop on the floor. He discovers each
			of his senses by trying to make some other
			sense work. If his mouth waters for the moon,
			and he tries to smack his lips on a lullaby, who
			shall smile at him, poor little fellow, making
			his sturdy lunges at this huge, impenetrable
			world? He is making his connection and getting
			his hold on his world of colour and sense
			and sound, with infinitely more truth and
			patience and precision and delight than nine
			out of ten of his elders are doing or have ever
			been able to do, in the world of books.</p>

			<p>The books that were written to be breathed—gravely
			chewed upon by the literary infants
			of this modern day,—who can number them?—books
			that were made to live in—vast, open
			clearings in the thicket of life—chapters like
			tents to dwell in under the wide heaven, visited
			like railway stations by excursion trains of
			readers,—books that were made to look down
			from—serene mountain heights criticised because
			factories are not founded on them—in
			every reading-room hundreds of people (who
			has not seen them?), looking up inspirations
			in encyclopædias, poring over poems for facts,
			looking in the clouds for seeds, digging in the
			ground for sunsets; and everywhere through
			all the world, the whole huddling, crowding
			mob of those who read, hastening on its endless
			paper-paved streets, from the pyramids of
			Egypt and the gates of Greece, to Pater Noster
			Row and the Old Corner Book Store—nearly
			<a class="pagenum" id="page61" title="61"> </a>all of them trying to make the wrong connections
			with the right things or the right connections
			with things they have no connection
			with, and only now and then a straggler lagging
			behind perhaps, at some left-over bookstall,
			who truly knows how to read, or some
			beautiful, over-grown child let loose in a library—making
			connections for himself, who
			knows the uttermost joy of a book.</p>

			<p>In seeking for a fundamental principle to
			proceed upon in the reading of books, it seems
			only reasonable to assert that the printed universe
			is governed by the same laws as the real
			one. If a child is to have his senses about
			him—his five reading senses—he must learn
			them in exactly the way he learns his five
			living senses. The most significant fact about
			the way a child learns the five senses he has to
			live with is, that no one can teach them to
			him. We do not even try to. There are still—thanks
			to a most merciful Heaven—five
			things left in the poor, experimented-on, battered,
			modern child, that a board of education
			cannot get at. For the first few months of his
			life, at least, it is generally conceded, the
			modern infant has his education—that is, his
			making connection with things—entirely in
			his own hands. That he learns more these
			first few months of his life when his education
			is in his own hands, than he learns in all the
			later days when he is surrounded by those who
			hope they are teaching him something, it may
			<a class="pagenum" id="page62" title="62"> </a>not be fair to say; but while it cannot be said
			that he learns more perhaps, what he does
			learn, he learns better, and more scientifically,
			than he is ever allowed to learn with ordinary
			parents and ordinary teachers and text-books
			in the years that come afterward. With most
			of us, this first year or so, we are obliged to
			confess, was the chance of our lives. Some of
			us have lived long enough to suspect that if
			we have ever really learned anything at all we
			must have learned it then.</p>

			<p>The whole problem of bringing to pass in
			others and of maintaining in ourselves a vital
			and beautiful relation to the world of books,
			turns entirely upon such success as we may
			have in calling back or keeping up in our attitude
			toward books, the attitude of the new-born
			child when he wakes in the sunshine of the
			earth, and little by little on the edge of the
			infinite, groping and slow, begins to make
			his connections with the universe. It cannot
			be over-emphasised that this new-born child
			makes these connections for himself, that the
			entire value of having these connections made
			is in the fact that he makes them for himself.
			As between the books in a library that ought
			to be read, and a new life standing in it, that
			ought to read them, the sacred thing is not the
			books the child ought to read. The sacred
			thing is the way the child feels about the
			books; and unless the new life, like the needle
			of a magnet trembling there under the whole
			<a class="pagenum" id="page63" title="63"> </a>wide heaven of them all, is allowed to turn and
			poise itself by laws of attraction and repulsion
			forever left out of our hands, the magnet is
			ruined. It is made a dead thing. It makes
			no difference how many similar books may be
			placed within range of the dead thing afterward,
			nor how many good reasons there may
			be for the dead thing’s being attracted to
			them, the poise of the magnet toward a book,
			which is the sole secret of any power that a
			book can have, is trained and disciplined out
			of it. The poise of the magnet, the magnet’s
			poising itself, is inspiration, and inspiration is
			what a book is for.</p>

			<p>If John Milton had had any idea when he
			wrote the little book called <cite>Paradise Lost</cite> that
			it was going to be used mostly during the
			nineteenth century to batter children’s minds
			with, it is doubtful if he would ever have had
			the heart to write it. It does not damage a book
			very much to let it lie on a wooden shelf little
			longer than it ought to. But to come crashing
			down into the exquisite filaments of a human
			brain with it, to use it to keep a brain from
			continuing to be a brain—that is, an organ
			with all its reading senses acting and reacting
			warm and living in it, is a very serious matter.
			It always ends in the same way, this modern
			brutality with books. Even Bibles cannot
			stand it. Human nature stands it least of all.
			That books of all things in this world, made
			to open men’s instincts with, should be so
			<a class="pagenum" id="page64" title="64"> </a>generally used to shut them up with, is one
			of the saddest signs we have of the caricature
			of culture that is having its way in our modern
			world. It is getting so that the only way the
			average dinned-at, educated modern boy, shut
			in with masterpieces, can really get to read is in
			some still overlooked moment when people are
			too tired of him to do him good. Then softly,
			perhaps guiltily, left all by himself with a book,
			he stumbles all of a sudden on his soul—steals
			out and loves something. It may not be
			the best, but listening to the singing of the
			crickets is more worth while than seeming to
			listen to the music of the spheres. It leads to
			the music of the spheres. All agencies, persons,
			institutions, or customs that interfere
			with this sensitive, self-discovering moment
			when a human spirit makes its connection in
			life with its ideal, that interfere with its being
			a genuine, instinctive, free and beautiful connection,
			living and growing daily of itself,—all
			influences that tend to make it a formal connection
			or a merely decorous or borrowed one,
			whether they act in the name of culture or
			religion or the state, are the profoundest, most
			subtle, and most unconquerable enemies of
			culture in the world.</p>

			<p>It is not necessary to contend for the doctrine
			of reading as one likes—using the word
			“likes” in the sense of direction and temperament—in
			its larger and more permanent sense.
			It is but necessary to call attention to the fact
			<a class="pagenum" id="page65" title="65"> </a>that the universe of books is such a very large
			and various universe, a universe in which so
			much that one likes can be brought to bear at
			any given point, that reading as one likes is
			almost always safe in it. There is always
			more of what one likes than one can possibly
			read. It is impossible to like any one thing
			deeply without discovering a hundred other
			things to like with it. One is infallibly led
			out. If one touches the universe vitally at
			one point, all the rest of the universe flocks to
			it. It is the way a universe is made.</p>

			<p>Almost anything can be accomplished with
			a child who has a habit of being eager with
			books, who respects them enough, and who respects
			himself enough, to leave books alone
			when he cannot be eager with them. Eagerness
			in reading counts as much as it does in
			living. A live reader who reads the wrong
			books is more promising than a dead one who
			reads the right ones. Being alive is the point.
			Anything can be done with life. It is the Seed
			of Infinity.</p>

			<p>While much might be said for the topical or
			purely scientific method in learning how to
			read, it certainly is not claiming too much for
			the human, artistic, or personal point of view
			in reading, that it comes first in the order of
			time in a developing life and first in the order
			of strategic importance. Topical or scientific
			reading cannot be fruitful; it cannot even be
			scientific, in the larger sense, except as, in its
			<a class="pagenum" id="page66" title="66"> </a>own time and in its own way, it selects itself
			in due time in a boy’s life, buds out, and is
			allowed to branch out, from his own inner
			personal reading.</p>

			<p>As the first and most important and most far-reaching
			of the arts of reading is the Art of
			Reading as One Likes, the principles, inspirations,
			and difficulties of reading as one likes
			are the first to be considered in the following
			chapters.</p>

			<p>The fact that the art of reading as one likes
			is the most difficult, perhaps the most impossible,
			of all the arts in modern times, constitutes
			one of those serio-comic problems of civilisation—a
			problem which civilisation itself, with all
			its swagger of science, its literary braggadocio,
			its Library Cure, with all its Board Schools,
			Commissioners of Education and specialists,
			and bishops and newsboys, all hard at work
			upon it, is only beginning to realise.</p>

			On Wondering Why One Was
			Born</h4>

			<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">The</span> real trouble with most of the attempts
			that teachers and parents make, to teach
			children a vital relation to books, is that they
			do not believe in the books and that they do
			not believe in the children.</p>

			<p>It is almost impossible to find a child who,
			in one direction or another, the first few years
			of his life, is not creative. It is almost impossible
			to find a parent or a teacher who does not
			discourage this creativeness. The discouragement
			begins in a small way, at first, in the
			<a class="pagenum" id="page68" title="68"> </a>average family, but as the more creative a
			child becomes the more inconvenient he is, as
			a general rule, every time a boy is caught
			being creative, something has to be done to him
			about it.</p>

			<p>It is a part of the nature of creativeness that
			it involves being creative a large part of the
			time in the wrong direction. Half-proud and
			half-stupefied parents, failing to see that the
			mischief in a boy is the entire basis of his education,
			the mainspring of his life, not being
			able to break the mainspring themselves, frequently
			hire teachers to help them. The
			teacher who can break a mainspring first and
			keep it from getting mended, is often the most
			esteemed in the community. Those who have
			broken the most, “secure results.” The spectacle
			of the mechanical, barren, conventional
			society so common in the present day to all
			who love their kind is a sign there is no withstanding.
			It is a spectacle we can only stand
			and watch—some of us,—the huge, dreary
			kinetoscope of it, grinding its cogs and wheels,
			and swinging its weary faces past our eyes.
			The most common sight in it and the one that
			hurts the hardest, is the boy who could be
			made into a man out of the parts of him that
			his parents and teachers are trying to throw
			away. The faults of the average child, as
			things are going just now, would be the making
			of him, if he could be placed in seeing hands.
			It may not be possible to educate a boy by
			<a class="pagenum" id="page69" title="69"> </a>using what has been left out of him, but it is
			more than possible to begin his education by
			using what ought to have been left out of him.
			So long as parents and teachers are either
			too dull or too busy to experiment with mischief,
			to be willing to pay for a child’s originality
			what originality costs, only the most hopeless
			children can be expected to amount to
			anything. If we fail to see that originality is
			worth paying for, that the risk involved in a
			child’s not being creative is infinitely more
			serious than the risk involved in his being
			creative in the wrong direction, there is little
			either for us or for our children to hope for, as
			the years go on, except to grow duller together.
			We do not like this growing duller together
			very well, perhaps, but we have the feeling at
			least that we have been educated, and when
			our children become at last as little interested
			in the workings of their minds, as parents and
			teachers are in theirs, we have the feeling that
			they also have been educated. We are not unwilling
			to admit, in a somewhat useless, kindly,
			generalising fashion, that vital and beautiful
			children delight in things, in proportion as
			they discover them, or are allowed to make
			them up, but we do not propose in the meantime
			to have our own children any more vital
			and beautiful than we can help. In four or
			five years they discover that a home is a place
			where the more one thinks of things, the more
			unhappy he is. In four or five years more
			<a class="pagenum" id="page70" title="70"> </a>they learn that a school is a place where
			children are expected not to use their brains
			while they are being cultivated. As long as
			he is at his mother’s breast the typical American
			child finds that he is admired for thinking
			of things. When he runs around the house
			he finds gradually that he is admired very
			much less for thinking of things. At school
			he is disciplined for it. In a library, if he has
			an uncommonly active mind, and takes the
			liberty of being as alive there, as he is outdoors,
			if he roams through the books, vaults
			over their fences, climbs up their mountains,
			and eats of their fruit, and dreams by their
			streams, or is caught camping out in their
			woods, he is made an example of. He is
			treated as a tramp and an idler, and if he cannot
			be held down with a dictionary he is looked
			upon as not worth educating. If his parents
			decide he shall be educated anyway, dead or
			alive, or in spite of his being alive, the more
			he is educated the more he wonders why he
			was born and the more his teachers from
			behind their dictionaries, and the other boys
			from underneath their dictionaries, wonder
			why he was born. While it may be a general
			principle that the longer a boy wonders why
			he was born in conditions like these, and the
			longer his teachers and parents wonder, the
			more there is of him, it may be observed that
			a general principle is not of very much comfort
			to the boy while the process of wondering is
			<a class="pagenum" id="page71" title="71"> </a>going on. There seems to be no escape from
			the process, and if, while he is being educated,
			he is not allowed to use himself, he can hardly
			be blamed for spending a good deal of his time
			in wondering why he is not some one else. In
			a half-seeing, half-blinded fashion he struggles
			on. If he is obstinate enough, he manages to
			struggle through with his eyes shut. Sometimes
			he belongs to a higher kind, and opens
			his eyes and struggles.</p>

			<p>With the average boy the struggle with the
			School and the Church is less vigorous than
			the struggle at home. It is more hopeless.
			A mother is a comparatively simple affair.
			One can either manage a mother or be managed.
			It is merely a matter of time. It is
			soon settled. There is something there. She
			is not boundless, intangible. The School and
			the Church are different. With the first fresh
			breaths of the world tingling in him, the youth
			stands before them. They are entirely new to
			him. They are huge, immeasurable, unaccountable.
			They loom over him—a part of
			the structure of the universe itself. A mother
			can meet one in a door. The problem is concentrated.
			The Church stretches beyond the
			sunrise. The School is part of the horizon of
			the earth, and what after all is his own life and
			who is he that he should take account of it?
			Out of space—out of time—out of history they
			come to him—the Church and the School.
			They are the assembling of all mankind around
			<a class="pagenum" id="page72" title="72"> </a>his soul. Each with its Cone of Ether, its
			desire to control the breath of his life, its
			determination to do his breathing for him, to
			push the Cone down over him, looms above
			him and above all in sight, before he speaks—before
			he is able to speak.</p>

			<p>It is soon over. He lies passive and insensible
			at last,—as convenient as though he were
			dead, and the Church and the School operate
			upon him. They remove as many of his
			natural organs as they can, put in Presbyterian
			ones perhaps, or School-Board ones instead.
			Those that cannot be removed are numbed.
			When the time is fulfilled and the youth is
			cured of enough life at last to like living with
			the dead, and when it is thought he is enough
			like every one else to do, he is given his degree
			and sewed up.</p>

			<p>After the sewing up his history is better

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page73" title="73"> </a>The main distinction of every greater or more

			The Top of the Bureau Principle</h4>

			<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">The</span> experience of being robbed of a story
			we are about to read, by the good friend who
			cannot help telling how it comes out, is an
			occasional experience in the lives of older
			people, but it sums up the main sensation of
			life in the career of a child. The whole existence
			of a boy may be said to be a daily—almost
			hourly—struggle to escape from being
			told things.</p>

			<p>It has been found that the best way to emphasise
			a fact in the mind of a bright boy is to
			discover some way of not saying anything
			about it. And this is not because human
			nature is obstinate, but because facts have been
			intended from the beginning of the world to
			speak for themselves, and to speak better than
			anyone can speak for them. When a fact
			speaks, God speaks. Considering the way
			that most persons who are talking about the
			truth see fit to rush in and interrupt Him, the
			wonder is not that children grow less and less
			interested in truth as they grow older, but that
			they are interested in truth at all—even lies
			about the truth.</p>

			<p>The real trouble with most men and women
			as parents is, that they have had to begin life
			with parents of their own. When the child’s
			first memory of God is a father or mother interrupting
			<a class="pagenum" id="page75" title="75"> </a>Him, he is apt to be under the impression,
			when he grows up, that God can only
			be introduced to his own children by never
			being allowed to get a word in. If we as
			much as see a Fact coming toward a child—most
			of us—we either run out where the child
			is, and bring him into the house and cry over
			him, or we rush to his side and look anxious
			and stand in front of the Fact, and talk to him
			about it.</p>

			<p>And yet it is doubtful if there has ever been
			a boy as yet worth mentioning, who did not
			wish we would stand a little more one side—let
			him have it out with things. He is very
			weary—if he really amounts to anything—of
			having everything about him prepared for
			him. There has never been a live boy who
			would not throw a store-plaything away in two
			or three hours for a comparatively imperfect
			plaything he had made himself. He is equally
			indifferent to a store Fact, and a boy who does
			not see through a store-God, or a store-book,
			or a store-education sooner than ninety-nine
			parents out of a hundred and sooner than most
			synods, is not worth bringing up.</p>

			<p>No just or comprehensive principle can be
			found to govern the reading of books that
			cannot be made to apply, by one who really
			believes it (though in varying degrees), to the
			genius and to the dolt. It is a matter of history
			that a boy of fine creative powers can
			only be taught a true relation to books through
			<a class="pagenum" id="page76" title="76"> </a>an appeal to his own discoveries; but what is
			being especially contended for, and what most
			needs to be emphasised in current education,
			is the fact that the boy of ordinary creative
			powers can only be taught to read in the same
			way—by a slower, broader, and more patient
			appeal to his own discoveries. The boy of no
			creative powers whatever, if he is ever born,
			should not be taught to read at all. Creation
			is the essence of knowing, and teaching him
			to read merely teaches him more ways of not
			knowing. It gives him a wider range of places
			to be a nobody in—takes away his last opportunity
			for thinking of anything—that is, getting
			the meaning of anything for himself. If
			a man’s heart does not beat for him, why substitute
			a hot-water bottle? The less a mind
			is able to do, the less it can afford to have anything
			done for it. It will be a great day for
			education when we all have learned that the
			genius and the dolt can only be educated—at
			different rates of speed—in exactly the same
			way. The trouble with our education now is,
			that many of us do not see that a boy who has
			been presented with an imitation brain is a
			deal worse off than a boy who, in spite of his
			teachers, has managed to save his real one,
			and has not used it yet.</p>

			<p>It is dangerous to give a program for a principle
			to those who do not believe in the
			principle, and who do not believe in it instinctively,
			but if a program were to be given it
			<a class="pagenum" id="page77" title="77"> </a>would be something like this: It would assume
			that the best way to do with an uncreative
			mind is to put the owner of it where his mind
			will be obliged to create.</p>

			<p>First. Decide what the owner of the mind
			most wants in the world.</p>

			<p>Second. Put this thing, whatever it may be
			where the owner of the mind cannot get it
			unless he uses his mind. Take pains to put
			it where he can get it, if he does use his mind.</p>

			<p>Third. Lure him on. It is education.</p>

			<p>If this principle is properly applied to books,
			there is not a human being living on the earth
			who will not find himself capable of reading
			books—as far as he goes—with his whole mind
			and his whole body. He will read a printed
			page as eagerly as he lives, and he will read it
			in exactly the same way that he lives—with
			his imagination. A boy lives with his imagination
			every hour of His life—except in school.
			The moment he discovers, or is allowed to
			discover, that reading a book and living a day
			are very much alike, that they are both parts
			of the same act, and that they are both properly
			done in the same way, he will drink up
			knowledge as Job did scorning, like water.</p>

			<p>But it is objected that many children are
			entirely imitative, and that the imagination
			cannot be appealed to with them and that they
			cut themselves off from creativeness at every
			point.</p>

			<p>While it is inevitable in the nature of things
			<a class="pagenum" id="page78" title="78"> </a>that many children should be largely imitative,
			there is not a child that does not do some of
			his imitating in a creative way, give the hint
			to his teachers even in his imitations, of where
			his creativeness would come if it were allowed
			to. His very blunders in imitating, point to
			desires that would make him creative of themselves,
			if followed up. Some children have
			many desires in behalf of which they become
			creative. Others are creative only in behalf
			of a few. But there is always a single desire
			in a child’s nature through which his creativeness
			can be called out.</p>

			<p>A boy learns to live, to command his body,
			through the desires which make him creative
			with it—hunger, and movement, and sleep—desires
			the very vegetables are stirred with,
			and the boy who does not find himself responding
			to them, who can help responding to them,
			does not exist. There may be times when a
			boy has no desire to fill himself with food, and
			when he has no desire to think, but if he is
			kept hungry he is soon found doing both—thinking
			things into his stomach. A stomach,
			in the average boy, will all but take the part
			of a brain itself, for the time being, to avoid
			being empty. If a human being is alive at all,
			there is always at least one desire he can be
			educated with, prodded into creativeness, until
			he learns the habit and the pleasure of it.
			The best qualification for a nurse for a child
			whose creativeness turns on his stomach, is a
			<a class="pagenum" id="page79" title="79"> </a>natural gift for keeping food on the tops of
			bureaus and shelves just out of reach. The
			best qualification for a teacher is infinite contrivance
			in high bureaus. The applying of
			the Top of the High Bureau to all knowledge
			and to all books is what true education is for.</p>

			<p>It is generally considered a dangerous thing
			to do, to turn a child loose in a library. It
			might fairly be called a dangerous thing to do
			if it were not much more dangerous not to.
			The same forces that wrought themselves into
			the books when they were being made can be
			trusted to gather and play across them on the
			shelves. These forces are the self-propelling
			and self-healing forces of the creative mood.
			The creative mood protects the books, and it
			protects all who come near the books. It protects
			from the inside. It toughens and makes
			supple. Parents who cannot trust a boy to
			face the weather in a library should never let
			him outdoors.</p>

			<p>Trusting a boy to the weather in a library
			may have its momentary embarrassments, but
			it is immeasurably the shortest and most natural
			way to bring him into a vital connection
			with books. The first condition of a vital connection
			with books is that he shall make the
			connection for himself. The relation will be
			vital in proportion as he makes it himself.</p>

			<p>The fact that he will begin to use his five
			reading senses by trying to connect in the
			wrong way, or by connecting with the wrong
			<a class="pagenum" id="page80" title="80"> </a>books or parts of books, is a reason, not for
			action on the part of parents and teachers, but
			for inspired waiting. As a vital relation to
			books is the most immeasurable outfit for living
			and the most perfect protection against the
			dangers of life, a boy can have, the one point
			to be borne in mind is not the book but the
			boy—the instinct of curiosity in the boy.</p>

			<p>A boy who has all his good discoveries in
			books made for him—spoiled for him, if he has
			any good material in him—will proceed to
			make bad ones. The vices would be nearly as
			safe from interference as the virtues, if they
			were faithfully cultivated in Sunday-schools or
			by average teachers in day-schools. Sin itself
			is uninteresting when one knows all about it.
			The interest of the average young man in
			many a more important sin to-day is only kept
			up by the fact that no one stands by with a
			book teaching him how to do it. Whatever
			the expression “original sin” may have meant
			in the first place, it means now that we are full
			of original sin because we are not given a
			chance to be original in anything else. A
			virtue may be defined as an act so good that a
			religiously trained youth cannot possibly learn
			anything more about it. A classic is a pleasure
			hurried into a responsibility, a book read
			by every man before he has anything to read
			it with. A classical author is a man who, if
			he could look ahead—could see the generations
			standing in rows to read his book,
			<a class="pagenum" id="page81" title="81"> </a>toeing the line to love it—would not read it
			himself.</p>

			<p>Any training in the use of books that does
			not base its whole method of rousing the instinct
			of curiosity, and keeping it aroused, is a
			wholesale slaughter, not only of the minds that
			might live in the books, but of the books themselves.
			To ignore the central curiosity of a
			child’s life, his natural power of self-discovery
			in books, is to dispense with the force of gravity
			in books, instead of taking advantage of it.</p>

			The First Person a Necessary Evil</h4>

			<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">Great</span> emphasis is being laid at the
			present time upon the tools that readers
			ought to have to do their reading with. We
			seem to be living in a reference-book age.
			Whatever else may be claimed for our own
			special generation it stands out as having one
			inspiration that is quite its own—the inspiration
			of conveniences. That these conveniences
			have their place, that one ought to have the
			best of them there can be no doubt, but it is
			very important to bear in mind, particularly in
			the present public mood, that if one cannot
			<a class="pagenum" id="page83" title="83"> </a>have all of these conveniences, or even the best
			of them, the one absolutely necessary reference
			book in reading the masters of literature is one
			that every man has.</p>

			<p>It is something of a commonplace—a rather
			modest volume with most of us, summed up on
			a tombstone generally, easily enough, but we
			are bound to believe after all is said and done
			that the great masterpiece among reference
			books, for every man,—the one originally intended
			by the Creator for every man to use,—is
			the reference book of his own life. We believe
			that the one direct and necessary thing
			for a man to do, if he is going to be a good
			reader, is to make, this reference book—his
			own private edition of it—as large and complete
			as possible. Everything refers to it,
			whatever his reading is. Shakespeare and the
			New York <cite>World</cite>, Homer and <cite>Harper’s Bazar</cite>,
			Victor Hugo and <cite>The Forum</cite>, <cite>Babyhood</cite> and
			the Bible all refer to it,—are all alike in making
			their references (when they are really looked
			up) to private editions. Other editions do not
			work. In proportion as they are powerful in
			modern life, all the books and papers that we
			have are engaged in the business of going
			about the world discovering people to themselves,
			unroofing first person singulars in it,
			getting people to use their own reference books
			on all life. Literature is a kind of vast international
			industry of comparing life. We read
			to look up references in our own souls. The
			<a class="pagenum" id="page84" title="84"> </a>immortality of Homer and the circulation of
			the <cite>Ladies’ Home Journal</cite> both conform to this
			fact, and it is equally the secret of the last
			page of <cite>Harper’s Bazar</cite> and of Hamlet and of
			the grave and monthly lunge of <cite>The Forum</cite> at
			passing events. The difference of appeal may
			be as wide as the east and the west, but the
			east and the west are in human nature and not
			in the nature of the appeal. The larger selves
			look themselves up in the greater writers and
			the smaller selves spell themselves out in the
			smaller ones. It is here we all behold as in
			some vast reflection or mirage of the reading
			world our own souls crowding and jostling,
			little and great, against the walls of their
			years, seeking to be let out, to look out, to look
			over, to look up—that they may find their possible
			selves.</p>

			<p>When men are allowed to follow what might
			be called the forces of nature in the reading
			world they are seen to read:</p>

			<p>1st. About themselves.</p>

			<p>2nd. About people they know.</p>

			<p>3rd. About people they want to know.</p>

			<p>4th. God.</p>

			<p>Next to their interest in persons is their interest
			in things:</p>

			<p>1st. Things that they have themselves.</p>

			<p>2nd. Things that people they know, have.</p>

			<p>3rd. Things they want to have.</p>

			<p>4th. Things they ought to want to have.</p>

			<p>5th. Other things.</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page85" title="85"> </a>6th. The universe—things God has.</p>

			<p>7th. God.</p>

			<p>A scale like this may not be very complimentary
			to human nature. Some of us feel
			that it is appropriate and possibly a little religious
			to think that it is not. But the scale
			is here. It is mere psychological-matter-of-fact.
			It is the way things are made, and
			while it may not be quite complimentary to
			human nature, it seems to be more complimentary
			to God to believe, in spite of appearances,
			that this scale from I to God is made
			right and should be used as it stands. It
			seems to have been in general use among our
			more considerable men in the world and among
			all our great men and among all who have
			made others great. They do not seem to have
			been ashamed of it. They have climbed up
			frankly on it—most of them, in full sight of all
			men—from I to God. They have claimed that
			everybody (including themselves) was identified
			with God, and they have made people believe
			it. It is the few in every generation
			who have dared to believe in this scale, and
			who have used it, who have been the leaders
			of the rest. The measure of a man’s being
			seems to be the swiftness with which his nature
			runs from the bottom of this scale to the top,
			the swiftness with which he identifies himself,
			says “I” in all of it. The measure of his ability
			to read on any particular subject is the swiftness
			with which he runs the scale from the
			<a class="pagenum" id="page86" title="86"> </a>bottom to the top on that subject, makes the
			trip with his soul from his own little I to God.
			When he has mastered the subject, he makes
			the run almost without knowing it, sees it as
			it is, <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</em>, identifies himself with God on it.
			The principle is one which reaches under all
			mastery in the world, from the art of prophecy
			even to the art of politeness. Tho man who
			makes the trip on any subject from the first
			person out through the second person to the
			farthest bounds of the third person,—that is,
			who identifies himself with all men’s lives, is
			called the poet or seer, the master-lover of persons.
			The man who makes the trip most
			swiftly from his own things to other men’s
			things and to God’s things—the Universe—is
			called the scientist, the master-lover of things.
			The God is he who identifies his own personal
			life, with all lives and his own things with all
			men’s things—who says “I” forever everywhere.</p>

			<p>The reason that the Hebrew Bible has had
			more influence in history than all other literatures
			combined, is that there are fewer emasculated
			men in it. The one really fundamental
			and astonishing thing about the Bible is the
			way that people have of talking about themselves
			in it. No other nation that has ever
			existed on the earth would ever have thought
			of daring to publish a book like the Bible. So
			far as the plot is concerned, the fundamental
			literary conception, it is all the Bible comes to
			<a class="pagenum" id="page87" title="87"> </a>practically—two or three thousand years of it—a
			long row of people talking about themselves.
			The Hebrew nation has been the
			leading power in history because the Hebrew
			man, in spite of all his faults has always had
			the feeling that God sympathised with him, in
			being interested in himself. He has dared to
			feel identified with God. It is the same in all
			ages—not an age but one sees a Hebrew in it,
			out under his lonely heaven standing and crying
			“God and I.” It is the one great spectacle
			of the Soul this little world has seen. Are not
			the mightiest faces that come to us flickering
			out of the dark, their faces? Who can look at
			the past who does not see—who does not always
			see—some mighty Hebrew in it singing and
			struggling with God? What is it—what else
			could it possibly be but the Hebrew soul, like
			a kind of pageantry down the years between us
			and God, that would ever have made us guess—men
			of the other nations—that a God belonged
			to us, or that a God could belong to us and be a
			God at all? Have not all the other races, each
			in their turn spawning in the sun and lost in
			the night, vanished because they could not say
			“I” before God? The nations that are left,
			the great nations of the modern world, are but
			the moral passengers of the Hebrews, hangers-on
			to the race that can say “I”—I to the <i>n</i><sup>th</sup>
			power,—the race that has dared to identify itself
			with God. The fact that the Hebrew, instead
			of saying God and I, has turned it around
			<a class="pagenum" id="page88" title="88"> </a>sometimes and said I and God is neither here
			nor there in the end. It is because the Hebrew
			has kept to the main point, has felt related to
			God (the main point a God cares about), that
			he has been the most heroic and athletic figure
			in human history—comes nearer to the God-size.
			The rest of the nations sitting about
			and wondering in the dark, have called this
			thing in the Hebrew “religious genius.” If
			one were to try to sum up what religious
			genius is, in the Hebrew, or to account for the
			spiritual and material supremacy of the Hebrew
			in history, in a single fact, it would be the fact
			that Moses, their first great leader, when he
			wanted to say “It seems to me,” said “The
			Lord said unto Moses.”</p>

			<p>The Hebrews may have written a book that
			teaches, of all others, self-renunciation, but the
			way they taught it was self-assertion. The
			Bible begins with a meek Moses who teaches
			by saying “The Lord said unto Moses,” and it
			comes to its climax in a lowly and radiant man
			who dies on a cross to say “I and the Father
			are one.” The man Jesus seems to have called
			himself God because he had a divine habit of
			identifying himself, because he had kept on
			identifying himself with others until the first
			person and the second person and the third
			person were as one to him. The distinction
			of the New Testament is that it is the one book
			the world has seen, which dispenses with pronouns.
			It is a book that sums up pronouns
			<a class="pagenum" id="page89" title="89"> </a>and numbers, singular and plural, first person,
			second and third person, and all, in the one
			great central pronoun of the universe. The
			very stars speak it—<span class="small_all_caps">WE</span>.</p>

			<p>We is a developed I.</p>

			<p>The first person may not be what it ought
			to be either as a philosophy or an experience,
			but it has been considered good enough to
			make Bibles out of, and it does seem as if a
			good word might occasionally be said for it in
			modern times, as if some one ought to be born
			before long, who will give it a certain standing,
			a certain moral respectability once more in
			human life and in the education of human life.</p>

			<p>It would not seem to be an overstatement
			that the best possible book to give a child to
			read at any time is the one that makes the
			most cross references at that time to his undeveloped
			We.</p>

			<h4 class="section_title"><abbr class="section_number" title="two">II</abbr><br/>
			The Art of Being Anonymous</h4>

			<p>The main difficulty in getting a child to live
			in the whole of his nature, to run the scale
			from the bottom to the top, from “I” to God,
			is to persuade his parents and teachers, and
			the people who crowd around him to educate
			him, that he must begin at the bottom.</p>

			<p>The Unpopularity of the First Person Singular
			in current education naturally follows from
			<a class="pagenum" id="page90" title="90"> </a>The Disgrace of the Imagination in it. Our
			typical school is not satisfied with cutting off a
			boy’s imagination about the outer world that
			lies around him. It amputates his imagination
			at its tap root. It stops a boy’s imagination
			about himself, and the issues, connections, and
			possibilities of his own life.</p>

			<p>Inasmuch as the education of a child—his
			relation to books—must be conducted either
			with reference to evading personality, or accumulating
			it, the issue is one that must be
			squarely drawn from the first. Beginning at
			the bottom is found by society at large to be
			such an inconvenient and painstaking process,
			that the children who are allowed to lay a
			foundation for personality—to say “I” in its
			disagreeable stages—seem to be confined, for
			the most part, to either one or the other of
			two classes—the Incurable or the Callous.
			The more thorough a child’s nature is, the
			more real his processes are, the more incurable
			he is bound to be—secretly if he is sensitive,
			and offensively if he is callous. In either case
			the fact is the same. The child unconsciously
			acts on the principle that self-assertion is self-preservation.
			One of the first things that he discovers
			is that self-preservation is the last thing
			polite parents desire in a child. If he is to be
			preserved, they will preserve him themselves.</p>

			<p>The conspiracy begins in the earliest days.
			The world rolls over him. The home and the
			church and the school and the printed book
			<a class="pagenum" id="page91" title="91"> </a>roll over him. The story is the same in all.
			Education—originally conceived as drawing a
			boy out—becomes a huge, elaborate, overwhelming
			scheme for squeezing him in—for
			keeping him squeezed in. He is mobbed on
			every side. At school the teachers crowd
			round him and say “I” for him. At home
			his parents say “I” for him. At church the
			preacher says “I” for him. And when he retreats
			into the privacy of his own soul and betakes
			himself to a book, the book is a classic
			and the book says “I” for him. When he
			says “I” himself after a few appropriate years,
			he says it in disguised quotation marks. If he
			cannot always avoid it—if in some unguarded
			moment he is particularly alive about something
			and the “I” comes out on it, society
			expects him to be ashamed of it, at least to
			avoid the appearance of not being ashamed of
			it. If he writes he is desired to say “we.”
			Sometimes he shades himself off into “the
			present writer.” Sometimes he capitulates in
			bare initials.</p>

			<p>There are very few people who do not live
			in quotation marks most of their lives. They
			would die in them and go to heaven in them,
			if they could. Nine times out of ten it is
			some one else’s heaven they want to go to.
			The number of people who would know what
			to do or how to act in this world or the next,
			without their quotation marks on, is getting
			more limited every year.</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page92" title="92"> </a>And yet one could not very well imagine a
			world more prostrate that this one is, before a
			man without quotation marks. It dotes on
			personality. It spends hundreds of years at a
			time in yearning for a great man. But it
			wants its great man finished. It is never willing
			to pay what he costs. It is particularly
			unwilling to pay what he costs as it goes along.
			The great man as a boy has had to pay for himself.
			The bare feat of keeping out of quotation
			marks has cost him generally more than he
			thought he was worth—and has had to be paid
			in advance.</p>

			<p>There is a certain sense in which it is true
			that every boy, at least at the point where he
			is especially alive, is a kind of great man in
			miniature—has the same experience, that is,
			in growing. Many a boy who has been regularly
			represented to himself as a monster, a
			curiosity of selfishness (and who has believed
			it), has had occasion to observe when he grew up
			that some of his selfishness was real selfishness
			and that some of it was life. The things he was
			selfish with, he finds as he grows older, are the
			things he has been making a man out of. As
			a boy, however, he does not get much inkling
			of this. He finds he is being brought up in a
			world where boys who so little know how to
			play with their things that they give them
			away, are pointed out to him as generous, and
			where boys who are so bored with their own
			minds that they prefer other people’s, are considered
			<a class="pagenum" id="page93" title="93"> </a>modest. If he knew in the days when
			models are being pointed out to him, that the
			time would soon come in the world for boys
			like these when it would make little difference
			either to the boys themselves, or to any one
			else, whether they were generous or modest or
			not, it would make his education happier. In
			the meantime, in his disgrace, he does not
			guess what a good example to models he is.
			Very few other people guess it.</p>

			<p>The general truth, that when a man has
			nothing to be generous with, and nothing to
			be modest about, even his virtues are superfluous,
			is realised by society at large in a
			pleasant helpless fashion in its bearing on the
			man, but its bearing on the next man, on education,
			on the problem of human development,
			is almost totally overlooked.</p>

			<p>The youth who grasps at everything in sight
			to have his experience with it, who cares more
			for the thing than he does for the person it
			comes from, and more for his experience with
			the thing than he does for the thing, is by no
			means an inspiring spectacle while this process
			is going on, and he is naturally in perpetual
			disgrace, but in proportion as they are wise,
			our best educators are aware that in all probability
			this same youth will wield more spiritual
			power in the world, and do more good in it,
			than nine or ten pleasantly smoothed and adjustable
			persons. His boy-faults are his man-virtues
			wrongside out.</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page94" title="94"> </a>There are very few lives of powerful men in
			modern times that do not illustrate this. The
			men who do not believe it—who do not approve
			of illustrating it, have illustrated it the
			most—devoted their lives to it. It would be
			hard to find a man of any special importance
			in modern biography who has not been indebted
			to the sins of his youth. “It is the
			things I ought not to have done—see page 93,
			179, 321,” says the average autobiography,
			“which have been the making of me.” “They
			were all good things for me to do (see page
			526, 632, 720), but I did not think so when I
			did them. Neither did any one else.” “Studying
			Shakespeare and the theatre in the theological
			seminary, and taking walks instead of
			examinations in college,” says the biography
			of Beecher (between the lines), “meant definite
			moral degeneration to me. I did habitually
			what I could not justify at the time, either to
			myself or to others, and I have had to make
			up since for all the moral degeneration, item
			by item, but the things I got with the degeneration
			when I got it—habits of imagination,
			and expression, headway of personality—are
			the things that have given me all my
			inspirations for being moral since.” “What
			love of liberty I have,” Wendell Phillips
			seems to say, “I got from loving my own.”
			It is the boy who loves his liberty so much
			that he insists on having it to do wrong with,
			as well as right, who in the long run gets the
			<a class="pagenum" id="page95" title="95"> </a>most right done. The basis of character is
			moral experiment and almost all the men who
			have discovered different or beautiful or right
			habits of life for men, have discovered them by
			doing wrong long enough. (The ice is thin at
			this point, Gentle Reader, for many of us,
			perhaps, but it has held up our betters.) The
			fact of the matter seems to be that a man’s
			conscience in this world, especially if it is an
			educated one, or borrowed from his parents,
			can get as much in his way as anything else.
			There is no doubt that The Great Spirit prefers
			to lead a man by his conscience, but if it
			cannot be done, if a man’s conscience has
			no conveniences for being led, He leads him
			against his conscience. The doctrine runs
			along the edge of a precipice (like all the best
			ones), but if there is one gift rather than another
			to be prayed for in this world it is the
			ability to recognise the crucial moment that
			sometimes comes in a human life—the moment
			when The Almighty Himself gets a man—against
			his conscience—to do right. It
			seems to be the way that some consciences are
			meant to grow, by trying wrong things on a
			little. Thousands of inferior people can be
			seen every day stumbling over their sins to
			heaven, while the rest of us are holding back
			with our virtues. It has been intimated from
			time to time in this world that all men are sinners.
			Inasmuch as things are arranged so
			that men can sin in doing right things, and
			<a class="pagenum" id="page96" title="96"> </a>sin in doing wrong ones both, they can hardly
			miss it. The real religion of every age seems
			to have looked a little askance at perfection,
			even at purity, has gone its way in a kind of
			fine straightforwardness, has spent itself in an
			inspired blundering, in progressive noble culminating
			moral experiment.</p>

			<p>The basis for a great character seems to be
			the capacity for intense experience with the
			character one already has. So far as most of
			us can judge, experience, in proportion as it
			has been conclusive and economical, has had to
			be (literally or with one’s imagination) in the
			first person. The world has never really
			wanted yet (in spite of appearances) its own
			way with a man. It wants the man. It is
			what he is that concerns it. All that it asks of
			him, and all that he has to give, is the surplus
			of himself. The trouble with our modern
			fashion of substituting the second person or the
			third person for the first, in a man’s education,
			is that it takes his capacity for intense experience
			of himself, his chance for having a surplus
			of himself, entirely away.</p>

			Egoism and Society</h4>

			<p>That the unpopularity of the first person
			singular is honestly acquired and heartily deserved,
			it would be useless to deny. Every one
			<a class="pagenum" id="page97" title="97"> </a>who has ever had a first person singular for a
			longer or shorter period in his life knows that it
			is a disagreeable thing and that every one else
			knows it, in nine cases out of ten, at least, and
			about nine tenths of the time during its development.
			The fundamental question does not
			concern itself with the first person singular
			being agreeable or disagreeable, but with what
			to do with it, it being the necessary evil that
			it is.</p>

			<p>It seems to be a reasonable position that
			what should be objected to in the interests of
			society, is not egoism, a man’s being interested
			in himself, but the lack of egoism, a man’s
			having a self that does not include others.
			The trouble would seem to be—not that people
			use their own private special monosyllable overmuch,
			but that there is not enough of it, that
			nine times out of ten, when they write “I” it
			should be written “i.”</p>

			<p>In the face of the political objection, the
			objection of the State to the first person singular,
			the egoist defends every man’s reading for
			himself as follows. Any book that is allowed
			to come between a man and himself is doing
			him and all who know him a public injury.
			The most important and interesting fact about
			a man, to other people, is his attitude toward
			himself. It determines his attitude toward
			every one else. The most fundamental question
			of every State is: “What is each man’s
			attitude in this State toward himself? What
			<a class="pagenum" id="page98" title="98"> </a>can it be?” A man’s expectancy toward himself,
			so far as the State is concerned, is the
			moral centre of citizenship. It determines
			how much of what he expects he will expect
			of himself, and how much he will expect of
			others and how much of books. The man
			who expects too much of himself develops
			into the headlong and dangerous citizen who
			threatens society with his strength—goes
			elbowing about in it—insisting upon living
			other people’s lives for them as well as his
			own. The man who expects too much of
			others threatens society with weariness. He
			is always expecting other people to do his living
			for him. The man who expects too much
			of books lives neither in himself nor in any one
			else. The career of the Paper Doll is open to
			him. History seems to be always taking turns
			with these three temperaments whether in art
			or religion or public affairs,—the over-manned,
			the under-manned, and the over-read—the
			Tyrant, the Tramp, and the Paper Doll. Between
			the man who keeps things in his own
			hands, and the man who does not care to, and
			the man who has no hands, the State has a
			hard time. Nothing could be more important
			to the existence of the State than that every
			man in it shall expect just enough of himself
			and just enough of others and just enough of
			the world of books. Living is adjusting these
			worlds to one another. The central fact about
			society is the way it helps a man with himself.
			<a class="pagenum" id="page99" title="99"> </a>The society which cuts a man off from himself
			cuts him still farther off from every one else.
			A man’s reading in the first person—enough
			to have a first person—enough to be identified
			with himself, is one of the defences of society.</p>

		<div id="section_1.3.4" class="section">

			i + I = We</h4>

			<p>The most natural course for a human being,
			who is going to identify himself with other
			people, is to begin by practising on himself.
			If he has not succeeded in identifying himself
			with himself, he makes very trying work of the
			rest of us. A man who has not learned to say
			“I” and mean something very real by it, has
			it not in his power, without dulness or impertinence,
			to say “you” to any living creature.
			If a man has not learned to say “you,”
			if he has not taken hold of himself, interpreted
			and adjusted himself to those who are
			face to face with him, the wider and more
			general privilege of saying “they,” of judging
			any part of mankind or any temperament
			in it, should be kept away from him. It is
			only as one has experienced a temperament,
			has in some mood of one’s life said “I” in
			that temperament, that one has the outfit for
			passing an opinion on it, or the outfit for living
			with it, or for being in the same world with it.</p>

			<p>There are times, it must be confessed, when
			<a class="pagenum" id="page100" title="100"> </a>Christ’s command, that every man shall love
			his neighbour as himself, seems inconsiderate.
			There are some of us who cannot help feeling,
			when we see a man coming along toward us
			proposing to love us a little while the way he
			loves himself, that our permission might have
			been asked. If there is one inconvenience
			rather than another in our modern Christian
			society, it is the general unprotected sense one
			has in it, the number of people there are about
			in it (let loose by Sunday-school teachers and
			others) who are allowed to go around loving
			other people the way they love themselves. A
			codicil or at least an explanatory footnote to
			the Golden Rule, in the general interest of
			neighbours, would be widely appreciated. How
			shall a man dare to love his neighbour as himself,
			until he loves himself, has a self that he
			really loves, a self he can really love, and
			loves it? There is no more sad or constant
			spectacle that this modern world has to face
			than the spectacle of the man who has overlooked
			himself, bustling about in it, trying to
			give honour to other people,—the man who
			has never been able to help himself, hurrying
			anxious to and fro as if he could help some one
			else.</p>

			<p>It is not too much to say “Charity begins at
			home.” Everything does. The one person
			who has the necessary training for being an
			altruist is the alert egoist who does not know
			he is an altruist. His service to society is a
			<a class="pagenum" id="page101" title="101"> </a>more intense and comprehensive selfishness.
			He would be cutting acquaintance with himself
			not to render it. When he says “I” he
			means “we,” and the second and third persons
			are grown dim to him.</p>

			<p>An absolutely perfect virtue is the conveying
			of a man’s self, with a truth, to others. The
			virtues that do not convey anything are cheap
			and common enough. Favours can be had
			almost any day from anybody, if one is not too
			particular, and so can blank staring self-sacrifices.
			One feels like putting up a sign over
			the door of one’s life, with some people: “Let
			no man do me a favour except he do it as a
			self-indulgence.” Even kindness wears out,
			shows through, becomes impertinent, if it is
			not a part of selfishness. It may be that there
			are certain rudimentary virtues the outer form
			of which had better be maintained in the world,
			whether they can be maintained spiritually—that
			is, thoroughly and egotistically, or not.
			If my enemy who lives under the hill will continue
			to not-murder me, I desire him to continue
			whether he enjoys not-murdering me or
			not. But it is no credit to him. Except in
			some baldly negative fashion as this, however,
			it is literally true that a man’s virtues are of
			little account to others except as they are of
			account to him, and except he enjoys them as
			much as his vices. The first really important
			shock that comes to a young man’s religious
			sentiment in this world is the number of
			<a class="pagenum" id="page102" title="102"> </a>bored-looking people around, doing right.
			An absolutely substantial and perfect love
			is transfigured selfishness. It is no mere
			playing with words to say this, nor is it
			substituting a comfortable and pleasant doctrine
			for a strenuous altruism. If it were as
			light and graceful an undertaking to have
			enough selfishness to go around, to live in the
			whole of a universe like this, as it is to slip out
			of even living in one’s self in it, like a mere
			shadow or altruist, egoism were superficial
			enough. As it is, egoism being terribly or
			beautifully alive, so far as it goes, is now and
			always has been, and always must be the running
			gear of the spiritual world—egoism socialised.
			The first person is what the second and
			third persons are made out of. Altruism, as
			opposed to egoism, except in a temporary
			sense, is a contradiction in terms. Unless a
			man has a life to identify other lives, with a
			self which is the symbol through which he
			loves all other selves and all other experiences,
			he is selfish in the true sense.</p>

			<p>With all our Galileos, Agassizes, and Shakespeares,
			the universe has not grown in its
			countless centuries. It has not been getting
			higher and wider over us since the human
			race began. It is not a larger universe. It is
			lived in by larger men, more all-absorbing, all-identifying,
			and selfish men. It is a universe
			in which a human being is duly born, given
			place with such a self as he happens to have,
			<a class="pagenum" id="page103" title="103"> </a>and he is expected to grow up to it. Barring
			a certain amount of wear and tear and a few
			minor rearrangements on the outside, it is the
			same universe that it was in the beginning,
			and is now and always will be quite the same
			universe, whether a man grows up to it or not.
			The larger universe is not one that comes with
			the telescope. It comes with the larger self,
			the self that by reaching farther and farther
			in, reaches farther and farther out. It is as if
			the sky were a splendour that grew by night
			out of his own heart, the tent of his love of
			God spreading its roof over the nature of
			things. The greater distance knowledge
			reaches, the more it has to be personal, because
			it has to be spiritual.</p>

			<p>The one thing that it is necessary to do in
			any part of the world to make any branch of
			knowledge or deed of mercy, a living and eager
			thing, is to get men to see how direct its bearing
			is upon themselves. The man who does
			not feel concerned when the Armenians are
			massacred, thousands of miles away, because
			there is a sea between, is not a different man
			in kind from the man who does feel concerned.
			The difference is one of degree. It is a matter
			of area in living. The man who does feel concerned
			has a larger self. He sees further, feels
			the cry as the cry of his own children. He
			has learned the oneness and is touched with
			the closeness, of the great family of the world.</p>

			The Autobiography of Beauty</h4>

			<p>But the brunt of the penalty of the unpopularity
			of the first person singular in modern
			society falls upon the individual. The hard
			part of it, for a man who has not the daily
			habit of being a companion to himself, is his
			own personal private sense of emptiness—of
			missing things. All the universe gets itself
			addressed to some one else—a great showy
			heartless pantomime it rolls over him, beckoning
			with its nights and days and winds and
			faces—always beckoning, but to some one else.
			All that seems to be left to him in a universe
			is a kind of keeping up appearances in it—a
			looking as if he lived—a hurrying, dishonest
			trying to forget. He dare not sit down and
			think. He spends his strength in racing with
			himself to get away from himself, and those
			greatest days of all in human life—the days
			when men grow old, world-gentle, and still
			and deep before their God, are the days he
			dreads the most. He can only look forward to
			old age as the time when a man sits down with
			his lie at last, and day after day and night
			after night faces infinite and eternal loneliness
			in his own heart.</p>

			<p>It is the man who cuts acquaintance with
			himself, who dares to be lonely with himself,
			who dares the supreme daring in this world.
			<a class="pagenum" id="page105" title="105"> </a>He and his loneliness are hermetically sealed
			up together in infinite Time, infinite Space,—not
			a great man of all that have been, not a
			star or flower, not even a great book that can
			get at him.</p>

			<p>It is the nature of a great book that in proportion
			as it is beautiful it makes itself helpless
			before a human soul. Like music or poetry or
			painting it lays itself radiant and open before
			all that lies before it—to everything or to
			nothing, whatever it may be. It makes the
			direct appeal. Before the days and years of a
			man’s life it stands. “Is not this so?” it says.
			It never says less than this. It does not know
			how to say more.</p>

			<p>A bare and trivial book stops with what it
			says itself. A great book depends now and
			forever upon what it makes a man say back,
			and if he does not say anything, if he does not
			bring anything to it to say, nothing out of his
			own observation, passion, experience, to be
			called out by the passing words upon the page,
			the most living book, in its board and paper
			prison, is a dead and helpless thing before a
			Dead Soul. The helplessness of the Dead
			Soul lies upon it.</p>

			<p>Perhaps there is no more important distinction
			between a great book and a little book
			than this—that the great book is always a
			listener before a human life, and the little book
			takes nothing for granted of a reader. It does
			not expect anything of him. The littler it is,
			<a class="pagenum" id="page106" title="106"> </a>the less it expects and the more it explains.
			Nothing that is really great and living explains.
			Living is enough. If greatness does
			not explain by being great, nothing smaller
			can explain it. God never explains. He
			merely appeals to every man’s first person
			singular. Religion is not what He has told to
			men. It is what He has made men wonder
			about until they have been determined to find
			out. The stars have never been published
			with footnotes. The sun, with its huge, soft
			shining on people, kept on with the shining
			even when the people thought it was doing so
			trivial and undignified and provincial a thing
			as to spend its whole time going around them,
			and around their little earth, that they might
			have light on it perchance, and be kept warm.
			The moon has never gone out of its way to
			prove that it is not made of green cheese.
			And this present planet we are allowed the use
			of from year to year, which was so little observed
			for thousands of generations that all the
			people on it supposed it was flat, made no answer
			through the centuries. It kept on burying
			them one by one, and waited—like a work of
			genius or a masterpiece.</p>

			<p>In proportion as a thing is beautiful, whether
			of man or God, it has this heroic helplessness
			about it with the passing soul or generation of
			souls. If people are foolish, it can but appeal
			from one dear, pitiful fool to another until
			enough of us have died to make it time for a
			<a class="pagenum" id="page107" title="107"> </a>wise man again. History is a series of crises
			like this, in which once in so often men who say
			“I” have crossed the lives of mortals—have
			puzzled the world enough to be remembered in
			it, like Socrates, or been abused by it enough
			to make it love them forever, like Christ.</p>

			<p>The greatest revelation of history is the patience
			of the beauty in it, and truth can always
			be known by the fact that it is the only thing
			in the wide world that can afford to wait. A
			true book does not go about advertising itself,
			huckstering for souls, arranging its greatness
			small enough. It waits. Sometimes for twenty
			years it waits for us, sometimes for forty, sometimes
			sixty, and then when the time is fulfilled
			and we come at length and lay before it the
			burden of the blind and blundering years we
			have tried to live, it does little with us, after
			all, but to bring these same years singing and
			crying and struggling back to us, that through
			their shadowy doors we may enter at last the
			confessional of the human heart, and cry out
			there, or stammer or whisper or sing there,
			the prophecy of our own lives. Dead words
			out of dead dictionaries the book brings to us.
			It is a great book because it is a listening book,
			because it makes the unspoken to speak and
			the dead to live in it. To the vanished pen
			and the yellowed paper of the man who writes
			to us, thy soul and mine, Gentle Reader, shall
			call back, “This is the truth.”</p>

			<p>If a book has force in it, whatever its literary
			<a class="pagenum" id="page108" title="108"> </a>form may be, or however disguised, it is biography
			appealing to biography. If a book has
			great force in it, it is autobiography appealing
			to autobiography. The great book is always
			a confession—a moral adventure with its
			reader, an incredible confidence.</p>

			The Country Boy in Literature</h4>

			<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">“Let</span> not any Parliament Member,” says
			Carlyle, “ask of the Present Editor
			‘What is to be done?’ Editors are not here
			to say, ‘How.’”</p>

			<p>“Which is both ungracious and tantalisingly
			elusive,” suggests a Professor of Literature,
			who has been recently criticising the Nineteenth
			Century.</p>

			<p>This criticism, as a part of an estimate of
			Thomas Carlyle, is not only a criticism on
			itself and an autobiography besides, but it
			sums up, in a more or less characteristic fashion
			<a class="pagenum" id="page110" title="110"> </a>perhaps, what might be called the ultra-academic
			attitude in reading. The ultra-academic
			attitude may be defined as the attitude of sitting
			down and being told things, and of expecting
			all other persons to sit down and be
			told things, and of judging all authors, principles,
			men, and methods accordingly.</p>

			<p>If the universe were what in most libraries
			and clubs to-day it is made to seem, a kind
			of infinite Institution of Learning, a Lecture
			Room on a larger scale, and if all the men in
			it, instead of doing and singing in it, had
			spent their days in delivering lectures to it,
			there would be every reason, in a universe
			arranged for lectures, why we should exact of
			those who give them, that they should make
			the truth plain to us—so plain that there
			would be nothing left for us to do, with truth,
			but to read it in the printed book, and then
			analyse the best analysis of it—and die.</p>

			<p>It seems to be quite generally true of those
			who have been the great masters of literature,
			however, that in proportion as they have been
			great they have proved to be as ungracious
			and as tantalisingly elusive as the universe
			itself. They have refused, without exception,
			to bear down on the word “how.” They have
			almost never told men what to do, and have
			confined themselves to saying something that
			would make them do it, and make them find
			a way to do it. This something that they
			have said, like the something that they have
			<a class="pagenum" id="page111" title="111"> </a>lived, has come to them they know not how,
			and it has gone from them they know not how,
			sometimes not even when. It has been incommunicable,
			incalculable, infinite, the subconscious
			self of each of them, the voice beneath
			the voice, calling down the corridors of the
			world.</p>

			<p>If a boy from the country were to stand in a
			city street before the window of a shop, gazing
			into it with open mouth, he would do more in
			five or six minutes to measure the power and
			calibre of the passing men and women than
			almost any device that could be arranged.
			Ninety-five out of a hundred of them, probably,
			would smile a superior smile at him and
			hurry on. Out of the remaining five, four
			would look again and pity him. One, perhaps,
			would honour and envy him.</p>

			<p>The boy who, in a day like the present one,
			is still vital enough to forget how he looks in
			enjoying something, is not only a rare and refreshing
			spectacle, but he is master of the most
			important intellectual and moral superiority
			a boy can be master of, and if, in spite of
			teachers and surroundings, he can keep this
			superiority long enough, or until he comes to
			be a man, he shall be the kind of man whose
			very faults shall be remembered better and
			cherished more by a doting world than the
			virtues of the rest of us.</p>

			<p>The most important fact—perhaps the only
			important fact—about James Boswell—the
			<a class="pagenum" id="page112" title="112"> </a>country boy of literature—is that, whatever
			may have been his limitations, he had the
			most important gift that life can give to a man—the
			gift of forgetting himself in it. In the
			Fleet Street of letters, smiling at him and jeering
			by him, who does not always see James
			Boswell, completely lost to the street, gaping
			at the soul of Samuel Johnson as if it were the
			show window of the world, as if to be allowed
			to look at a soul like this were almost to have
			a soul one’s self?</p>

			<p>Boswell’s <cite>Life of Johnson</cite> is a classic because
			James Boswell had the classic power in him of
			unconsciousness. To book-labourers, college
			employees, analysis-hands of whatever kind,
			his book is a standing notice that the prerogative
			of being immortal is granted by men,
			even to a fool, if he has the grace not to know
			it. For that matter, even if the fool knows he
			is a fool, if he cares more about his subject than
			he cares about not letting any one else know it,
			he is never forgotten. The world cannot afford
			to leave such a fool out. Is it not a world in
			which there is not a man living of us who does
			not cherish in his heart a little secret like this of
			his own? We are bound to admit that the main
			difference between James Boswell and the rest,
			consists in the fact that James Boswell found
			something in the world so much more worth living
			for, than not letting the common secret out,
			that he lived for it, and like all the other great
			naïves he will never get over living for it.</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page113" title="113"> </a>Even allowing that Boswell’s consistent and
			unfailing motive in cultivating Samuel Johnson
			was vanity, this very vanity of Boswell’s has
			more genius in it than Johnson’s vocabulary,
			and the important and inspiring fact remains,
			that James Boswell, a flagrantly commonplace
			man in every single respect, by the law of letting
			himself go, has taken his stand forever in English
			literature, as the one commonplace man in
			it who has produced a work of genius. The
			main quality of a man of genius, his power of
			sacrificing everything to his main purpose, belonged
			to him. He was not only willing to
			seem the kind of fool he was, but he did not
			hesitate to seem several kinds that he was
			not, to fulfil his main purpose. That Samuel
			Johnson might be given the ponderous and
			gigantic and looming look that a Samuel Johnson
			ought to have, Boswell painted himself into
			his picture with more relentlessness than any
			other author that can be called to mind, except
			three or four similarly commonplace and
			similarly inspired and self-forgetful persons in
			the New Testament. There has never been
			any other biography in England with the
			single exception of Pepys, in which the author
			has so completely lost himself in his subject.
			If the author of Johnson’s life had written his
			book with the inspiration of not being laughed
			at (which is the inspiration that nine out of
			ten who love to laugh are likely to write with),
			James Boswell would never have been heard
			<a class="pagenum" id="page114" title="114"> </a>of, and the burly figure of Samuel Johnson
			would be a blur behind a dictionary.</p>

			<p>It may be set down as one of the necessary
			principles of the reading habit that no true and
			vital reading is possible except as the reader
			possesses and employs the gift of letting himself
			go. It is a gift that William Shakespeare
			and James Boswell and Elijah and Charles
			Lamb and a great many other happy but unimportant
			people have had in common. No
			man of genius—a man who puts his best and
			his most unconscious self into his utterance—can
			be read or listened to or interpreted for
			one moment without it. Except from those
			who bring to him the greeting of their own
			unconscious selves, he hides himself. He
			gives himself only to those with whom unconsciousness
			is a daily habit, with whom the joy
			of letting one’s self go is one of the great resources
			of life. This joy is back of every great
			act and every deep appreciation in the world,
			and it is the charm and delight of the smaller
			ones. On its higher levels, it is called genius
			and inspiration. In religion it is called faith.
			It is the primal energy both of art and religion.</p>

			<p>Probably only the man who has very little
			would be able to tell what faith is, as a basis
			of art or religion, but we have learned some
			things that it is not. We know that faith is
			not a dead-lift of the brain, a supreme effort
			either for God or for ourselves. It is the soul
			giving itself up, finding itself, feeling itself
			<a class="pagenum" id="page115" title="115"> </a>drawn to its own, into infinite space, face to
			face with strength. It is the supreme swinging-free
			of the spirit, the becoming a part of
			the running-gear of things. Faith is not an
			act of the imagination—to the man who knows
			it. It is infinite fact, the infinite crowding of
			facts, the drawing of the man-self upward and
			outward, where he is surrounded with the infinite
			man-self. Perhaps a man can make himself
			not believe. He can not make himself
			believe. He can only believe by letting himself
			go, by trusting the force of gravity and
			the law of space around him. Faith is the
			universe flowing silently, implacably, through
			his soul. He has given himself up to it. In
			the tiniest, noisiest noon his spirit is flooded
			with the stars. He is let out to the boundaries
			of heaven and the night-sky bears him up in
			the heat of the day.</p>

			<p>In the presence of a great work of art—a
			work of inspiration or faith, there is no such
			thing as appreciation, without letting one’s
			self go.</p>

			The Subconscious Self</h4>

			<p>The criticism of Carlyle’s remark, “Editors
			are not here to say ‘How,’”—that it is “ungracious
			and tantalisingly elusive,” is a fair
			illustration of the mood to which the habit of
			<a class="pagenum" id="page116" title="116"> </a>analysis leads its victims. The explainer cannot
			let himself go. The puttering love of explaining
			and the need of explaining dog his
			soul at every turn of thought or thought of
			having a thought. He not only puts a microscope
			to his eyes to know with, but his eyes
			have ingrown microscopes. The microscope
			has become a part of his eyes. He cannot see
			anything without putting it on a slide, and
			when his microscope will not focus it, and it
			cannot be reduced and explained, he explains
			that it is not there.</p>

			<p>The man of genius, on the other hand, with
			whom truth is an experience instead of a specimen,
			has learned that the probabilities are that
			the more impossible it is to explain a truth
			the more truth there is in it. In so far as the
			truth is an experience to him, he is not looking
			for slides. He will not mount it as a specimen
			and he is not interested in seeing it explained
			or focussed. He lives with it in his own heart
			in so far as he possesses it, and he looks at it
			with a telescope for that greater part which he
			cannot possess. The microscope is perpetually
			mislaid. He has the experience itself and the
			one thing he wants to do with it is to convey
			it to others. He does this by giving himself
			up to it. The truth having become a part of
			him by his thus giving himself up, it becomes
			a part of his reader, by his reader’s giving
			himself up.</p>

			<p>Reading a work of genius is one man’s unconsciousness
			<a class="pagenum" id="page117" title="117"> </a>greeting another man’s. No
			author of the higher class can possibly be read
			without this mutual exchange of unconsciousness.
			He cannot be explained. He cannot
			explain himself. And he cannot be enjoyed,
			appreciated, or criticised by those who expect
			him to. Spiritual things are spiritually discerned,
			that is, experienced things are discerned
			by experience. They are “ungracious
			and tantalisingly elusive.”</p>

			<p>When the man who has a little talent tells a
			truth he tells the truth so ill that he is obliged
			to tell how to do it. The artist, on the other
			hand, having given himself up to the truth,
			almost always tells it as if he were listening to
			it, as if he were being borne up by it, as by
			some great delight, even while he speaks to us.
			It is the power of the artist’s truth when he
			writes like this that it shall haunt his reader
			as it has haunted him. He lives with it and
			is haunted by it day after day whether he
			wants to be or not, and when a human being
			is obliged to live with a burning truth inside
			of him every day of his life, he will find a how
			for it, he will find some way of saying it, of
			getting it outside of him, of doing it, if only
			for the common and obvious reason that it
			burns the heart out of a man who does not.
			If the truth is really in a man—a truth to be
			done,—he finds out how to do it as a matter of
			self-preservation.</p>

			<p>The average man no doubt will continue
			<a class="pagenum" id="page118" title="118"> </a>now as always to consider Carlyle’s “Editors
			are not here to say ‘How’” ungracious and
			tantalisingly elusive. He demands of every
			writer not only that he shall write the truth
			for every man but that he shall—practically—read
			it for him—that is, tell him how to read
			it—the best part of reading it. It is by this
			explaining the truth too much, by making it
			small enough for small people that so many lies
			have been made out of it. The gist of the
			matter seems to be that if the spirit of the truth
			does not inspire a man to some more eager way
			of finding out how to do a truth than asking
			some other man how to do it, it must be some
			other spirit. The way out for the explotterating
			or weak man does not consist in the scientist’s
			or the commentator’s how, or the
			artist’s how, or in any other strain of helping
			the ground to hold one up. It consists in the
			power of letting one’s self go.</p>

			<p>To say nothing of appreciation of power,
			criticism of power is impossible, without letting
			one’s self go. Criticism which is not the
			faithful remembering and reporting of an unconscious
			mood is not worthy of being called
			criticism at all. A critic cannot find even the
			faults of a book who does not let himself go in
			it, and there is not a man living who can expect
			to write a criticism of a book until he has
			given himself a chance to have an experience
			with it, to write his criticism with. The larger
			part of the professional criticism of the ages
			<a class="pagenum" id="page119" title="119"> </a>that are past has proved worthless to us, because
			the typical professional critic has generally
			been a man who professes not to let
			himself go and who is proud of it. If it were
			not for the occasional possibility of his being
			stunned by a book—made unconscious by it,—the
			professional critic of the lesser sort would
			never say anything of interest to us at all, and
			even if he did, being a maimed and defective
			conscious person, the evidence that he was
			stunned is likely to be of more significance
			than anything he may say about the book that
			stunned him, or about the way he felt when he
			was being stunned. Having had very little
			practice in being unconscious, the bare fact is
			all that he can remember about it. The unconsciousness
			of a person who has long lost the
			habit of unconsciousness is apt to be a kind
			of groping stupor or deadness at its best, and
			not, as with the artist, a state of being, a way
			of being incalculably alive, and of letting in
			infinite life. It is a small joy that is not unconscious.
			The man who knows he is reading
			when he has a book in his hands, does not
			know very much about books.</p>

			<p>People who always know what time it is, who
			always know exactly where they are, and exactly
			how they look, have it not in their power
			to read a great book. The book that comes to
			the reader as a great book is always one that
			shares with him the infinite and the eternal in
			himself.</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page120" title="120"> </a>There is a time to know what time it is, and
			there is a time not to, and there are many
			places small enough to know where they are.
			The book that knows what time it is, in every
			sentence, will always be read by the clock, but
			the great book, the book with infinite vistas in
			it, shall not be read by men with a rim of time
			around it. The place of it is unmeasured, and
			there is no sound that men can make which
			shall tick in that place.</p>

			The Organic Principle of Inspiration</h4>

			<p>Letting one’s self go is but a half-principle,
			however, to do one’s reading with. The other
			half consists in getting one’s self together
			again. In proportion as we truly appreciate
			what we read, we find ourselves playing; at being
			Boswell to a book and being Johnson to it
			by turns. The vital reader lets himself go and
			collects himself as the work before him demands.
			There are some books, where it is
			necessary to let one’s self go from beginning
			to end. There are others where a man may
			sit as he sits at a play, being himself between
			acts, or at proper intervals when the author lets
			down the curtain, and being translated the rest
			of the time.</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page121" title="121"> </a>Our richest moods are those in which, as we
			look back upon them, we seem to have been
			impressing, impressionable, creative, and receptive
			at the same time. The alternating
			currents of these moods are so swift that they
			seem simultaneous, and the immeasurable
			swiftness with which they pass from one to the
			other is the soul’s instinctive method of kindling
			itself—the very act of inspiration. Sometimes
			the subconscious self has it all its own
			way with us except for a corner of dim, burning
			consciousness keeping guard. Sometimes
			the conscious has it all its own way with us
			and the subconscious self is crowded to the
			horizon’s edge, like Northern Lights still playing
			in the distance; but the result is the same—the
			dim presence of one of these moods in
			the other, when one’s power is least effective,
			and the gradual alternating of the currents
			of the moods as power grows more effective.
			In the higher states of power, the moods
			are seen alternating with increasing heat and
			swiftness until in the highest state of power
			of all, they are seen in their mutual glow and
			splendour, working as one mood, creating
			miracles.</p>

			<p>The orator and the listener, the writer and
			the reader, in proportion as they become alive
			to one another, come into the same spirit—the
			spirit of mutual listening and utterance. At
			the very best, and in the most inspired mood,
			the reader reads as if he were a reader and
			<a class="pagenum" id="page122" title="122"> </a>writer both, and the writer writes as if he were
			a writer and reader both.</p>

			<p>While it is necessary in the use and development
			of power, that all varieties and combinations
			of these moods should be familiar
			experiences with the artist and with the reader
			of the artist, it remains as the climax and
			ideal of all energy and beauty in the human
			soul that these moods shall be found alternating
			very swiftly—to all appearances together.
			The artist’s command of this alternating current,
			the swiftness with which he modulates
			these moods into one another, is the measure
			of his power. The violinist who plays best is
			the one who sings the most things together in
			his playing. He listens to his own bow, to
			the heart of his audience, and to the soul of
			the composer all at once. His instrument
			sings a singing that blends them together.
			The effect of their being together is called art.
			The effect of their being together is produced
			by the fact that they are together, that they
			are born and living and dying together in the
			man himself while the strings are singing to
			us. They are the spirit within the strings.
			His letting himself go to them, his gathering
			himself out of them, his power to receive and
			create at once, is the secret of the effect he
			produces. The power to be receptive and
			creative by turns is only obtained by constant
			and daily practice, and when the modulating
			of one of these moods into the other becomes a
			<a class="pagenum" id="page123" title="123"> </a>swift and unconscious habit of life, what is
			called “temperament” in an artist is attained
			at last and inspiration is a daily occurrence.
			It is as hard for such a man to keep from being
			inspired as it is for the rest of us to make ourselves
			inspired. He has to go out of his way
			to avoid inspiration.</p>

			<p>In proportion as this principle is recognised
			and allowed free play in the habits that obtain
			amongst men who know books, their habits
			will be inspired habits. Books will be read
			and lived in the same breath, and books that
			have been lived will be written.</p>

			<p>The most serious menace in the present
			epidemic of analysis in our colleges is not that
			it is teaching men to analyse masterpieces
			until they are dead to them, but that it is
			teaching men to analyse their own lives until
			they are dead to themselves. When the process
			of education is such that it narrows the
			area of unconscious thinking and feeling in a
			man’s life, it cuts him off from his kinship
			with the gods, from his habit of being unconscious
			enough of what he has to enter into the
			joy of what he has not.</p>

			<p>The best that can be said of such an education
			is that it is a patient, painstaking, laborious
			training in locking one’s self up. It dooms a
			man to himself, the smallest part of himself,
			and walls him out of the universe. He comes
			to its doorways one by one. The shining of
			them falls at first on him, as it falls on all of
			<a class="pagenum" id="page124" title="124"> </a>us. He sees the shining of them and hastens
			to them. One by one they are shut in his
			face. His soul is damned—is sentenced to
			perpetual consciousness of itself. What is
			there that he can do next? Turning round
			and round inside himself, learning how little
			worth while it is, there is but one fate left
			open to such a man, a blind and desperate
			lunge into the roar of the life he cannot see,
			for facts—the usual L.H.D., Ph.D. fate. If
			he piles around him the huge hollow sounding
			outsides of things in the universe that have
			lived, bones of soul, matter of bodies, skeletons
			of lives that men have lived, who shall blame
			him? He wonders why they have lived, why
			any one lives; and if, when he has wondered
			long enough why any one lives, we choose to
			make him the teacher of the young, that the
			young also may wonder why any one lives,
			why should we call him to account? He cannot
			but teach what he has, what has been
			given him, and we have but ourselves to thank
			that, as every radiant June comes round,
			diplomas for ennui are being handed out—thousands
			of them—to specially favoured
			children through all this broad and glorious
			land.</p>

			If Shakespeare Came to Chicago</h4>

			<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">It</span> is one of the supreme literary excellences
			of the Bible that, until the other day almost,
			it had never occurred to any one that it
			is literature at all. It has been read by men
			and women, and children and priests and
			popes, and kings and slaves and the dying
			of all ages, and it has come to them not as a
			book, but as if it were something happening to
			them.</p>

			<p>It has come to them as nights and mornings
			come, and sleep and death, as one of the
			great, simple, infinite experiences of human
			life. It has been the habit of the world to take
			the greatest works of art, like the greatest
			<a class="pagenum" id="page126" title="126"> </a>works of God, in this simple and straightforward
			fashion, as great experiences. If a
			masterpiece really is a masterpiece, and rains
			and shines its instincts on us as masterpieces
			should, we do not think whether it is literary
			or not, any more than we gaze on mountains
			and stop to think how sublimely scientific,
			raptly geological, and logically chemical they
			are. These things are true about mountains,
			and have their place. But it is the nature of a
			mountain to insist upon its own place—to be
			an experience first and to be as scientific and
			geological and chemical as it pleases afterward.
			It is the nature of anything powerful to be an
			experience first and to appeal to experience.
			When we have time, or when the experience
			is over, a mountain or a masterpiece can be
			analysed—the worst part of it; but we cannot
			make a masterpiece by analysing it; and a
			mountain has never been appreciated by pounding
			it into trap, quartz, and conglomerate; and
			it still holds good, as a general principle, that
			making a man appreciate a mountain by pounding
			it takes nearly as long as making the
			mountain, and is not nearly so worth while.</p>

			<p>Not many years ago, in one of our journals
			of the more literary sort, there appeared a few
			directions from Chicago University to the late
			John Keats on how to write an “Ode to a
			Nightingale.” These directions were from the
			Head of a Department, who, in a previous paper
			in the same journal, had rewritten the “Ode to
			<a class="pagenum" id="page127" title="127"> </a>a Grecian Urn.” The main point the Head of
			the Department made, with regard to the nightingale,
			was that it was not worth rewriting.
			“‘The Ode to the Nightingale,’” says he,
			“offers me no such temptation. There is almost
			nothing in it that properly belongs to
			the subject treated. The faults of the Grecian
			Urn are such as the poet himself, under wise
			criticism” (see catalogue of Chicago University)
			“might easily have removed. The faults
			of the Nightingale are such that they cannot
			be removed. They inhere in the idea and
			structure.” The Head of the Department
			dwells at length upon “the hopeless fortune
			of the poem,” expressing his regret that it can
			never be retrieved. After duly analysing what
			he considers the poem’s leading thought, he
			regrets that a poet like John Keats should go
			so far, apropos of a nightingale, as to sigh in
			his immortal stanzas, “for something which,
			whatever it may be, is nothing short of a dead
			drunk.”</p>

			<p>One hears the soul of Keats from out its
			eternal Italy—</p>

			<div class="poem">
				<p>“Is there no one near to help me</p>
				<p class="i14">… No fair dawn</p>
				<p>Of life from charitable voice? No sweet saying</p>
				<p>To set my dull and sadden’d spirit playing?”</p>
			</div>

			<p class="continued_paragraph">The Head of the Department goes on, and the
			lines—</p>

			<div class="poem">
				<p><a class="pagenum" id="page128" title="128"> </a>Still wouldst thou sing and I have ears in vain—</p>
				<p>To thy high requiem become a sod—</p>

			<p class="continued_paragraph">are passed through analysis. “What the fitness
			is,” he says, “or what the poetic or other
			effectiveness of suggesting that the corpse of a
			person who has ceased upon the midnight still
			has ears, only to add that it has them in vain, I
			cannot pretend to understand”—one of a great
			many other things that the Head of the Department
			does not pretend to understand. It
			is probably with the same outfit of not pretending
			to understand that—for the edification of
			the merely admiring mind—the “Ode to a
			Grecian Urn” was rewritten. To Keats’s
			lines—</p>

			<div class="poem">
				<p>Oh, Attic shape! Fair attitude! with brede</p>
				<p class="i2">Of marble men and maidens overwrought,</p>
				<p>With forest branches and the trodden weed;</p>

				<p>Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know—</p>
			</div>

			<p class="continued_paragraph">he makes various corrections, offering as a
			substitute-conclusion to the poet’s song the
			following outburst:</p>

			<div class="poem">
				<p>Preaching this wisdom with thy cheerful mien:</p>
				<p>Possessing beauty thou possessest all;</p>
				<p>Pause at that goal, nor farther push thy quest.</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page129" title="129"> </a>It would not be just to the present state of
			academic instruction in literature to illustrate
			it by such an extreme instance as this of the
			damage the educated mind—debauched with
			analysis—is capable of doing to the reading
			habit. It is probable that a large proportion of
			the teachers of literature in the United States,
			both out of their sense of John Keats and out
			of respect to themselves, would have publicly
			resented this astonishing exhibit of the extreme
			literary-academic mind in a prominent
			journal, had they not suspected that its editor,
			having discovered a literary-academic mind
			that could take itself as seriously as this, had
			deliberately brought it out as a spectacle. It
			could do no harm to Keats, certainly, or to any
			one else, and would afford an infinite deal of
			amusement—the journal argued—to let a mind
			like this clatter down a column to oblivion.
			So it did. It was taken by all concerned,
			teachers, critics, and observers alike, as one
			of the more interesting literary events of the
			season.</p>

			<p>Unfortunately, however, entertainments of
			this kind have a very serious side to them. It
			is one thing to smile at an individual when one
			knows that standing where he does he stands
			by himself, and another to smile at an individual
			when one knows that he is not standing
			by himself, that he is a type, that there must
			be a great many others like him or he would
			not be standing where he does at all. When
			<a class="pagenum" id="page130" title="130"> </a>a human being is seen taking his stand over
			his own soul in public print, summing up its
			emptiness there, and gloating over it, we are
			in the presence of a disheartening fact. It can
			be covered up, however, and in what, on the
			whole, is such a fine, true-ringing, hearty old
			world as this, it need not be made much of;
			but when we find that a mind like this has
			been placed at the head of a Department of
			Poetry in a great, representative American
			university, the last thing that should be done
			with it is to cover it up. The more people
			know where the analytical mind is to-day—where
			it is getting to be—and the more they
			think what its being there means, the better.
			The signs of the times, the destiny of education,
			and the fate of literature are all involved
			in a fact like this. The mere possibility of
			having the analysing-grinding mind engaged
			in teaching a spontaneous art in a great educational
			institution would be of great significance.
			The fact that it is actually there and that no
			particular comment is excited by its being
			there, is significant. It betrays not only what
			the general, national, academic attitude toward
			literature is, but that that attitude has become
			habitual, that it is taken for granted.</p>

			<p>One would be inclined to suppose, looking
			at the matter abstractly, that all students and
			teachers of literature would take it for granted
			that the practice of making a dispassionate
			criticism of a passion would be a dangerous
			<a class="pagenum" id="page131" title="131"> </a>practice for any vital and spontaneous nature—certainly
			the last kind of practice that a
			student of the art of poetry (that is, the art of
			literature, in the essential sense) would wish
			to make himself master of. The first item in
			a critic’s outfit for criticising a passion is having
			one. The fact that this is not regarded as
			an axiom in our current education in books is
			a very significant fact. It goes with another
			significant fact—the assumption, in most
			courses of literature as at present conducted,
			that a little man (that is, a man incapable of a
			great passion), who is not even able to read a
			book with a great passion in it, can somehow
			teach other people to read it.</p>

			<p>It is not necessary to deny that analysis occasionally
			plays a valuable part in bringing a
			pupil to a true method and knowledge of
			literature, but unless the analysis is inspired
			nothing can be more dangerous to a pupil under
			his thirtieth year, even for the shortest period
			of time, or more likely to move him over to the
			farthest confines of the creative life, or more
			certain, if continued long enough, to set him
			forever outside all power or possibility of power,
			either in the art of literature or in any of the
			other arts.</p>

			<p>The first objection to the analysis of one of
			Shakespeare’s plays as ordinarily practised in
			courses of literature is that it is of doubtful
			value to nine hundred and ninety-nine pupils
			in a thousand—if they do it. The second is,
			<a class="pagenum" id="page132" title="132"> </a>that they cannot do it. The analysing of one
			of Shakespeare’s plays requires more of a
			commonplace pupil than Shakespeare required
			of himself. The apology that is given for the
			analysing method is, that the process of analysing
			a work of Shakespeare’s will show the pupil
			how Shakespeare did it, and that by seeing
			how Shakespeare did it he will see how to do
			it himself.</p>

			<p>In the first place, analysis will not show how
			Shakespeare did it, and in the second place, if
			it does, it will show that he did not do it by
			analysis. In the third place,—to say nothing
			of not doing it by analysis,—if he had analysed
			it before he did it, he could not have analysed
			it afterward in the literal and modern sense. In
			the fourth place, even if Shakespeare were able
			to do his work by analysing it before he did it, it
			does not follow that undergraduate students can.</p>

			<p>A man of genius, with all his onset of natural
			passion, his natural power of letting himself
			go, could doubtless do more analysing, both
			before and after his work, than any one else
			without being damaged by it. What shall be
			said of the folly of trying to teach men of
			talent, and the mere pupils of men of talent,
			by analysis—by a method, that is, which, even
			if it succeeds in doing what it tries to do, can
			only, at the very best, reveal to the pupil the
			roots of his instincts before they have come
			up? And why is it that our courses of literature
			may be seen assuming to-day on every
			<a class="pagenum" id="page133" title="133"> </a>hand, almost without exception, that by teaching
			men to analyse their own inspirations—the
			inspirations they have—and teaching them to
			analyse the inspirations of other men—inspirations
			they can never have—we are somehow
			teaching them “English literature”?</p>

			<p>It seems to have been overlooked while we
			are all analytically falling at Shakespeare’s
			feet, that Shakespeare did not become Shakespeare
			by analytically falling at any one’s feet—not
			even at his own—and that the most important
			difference between being a Shakespeare
			and being an analyser of Shakespeare is that
			with the man Shakespeare no submitting of
			himself to the analysis-gymnast would ever
			have been possible, and with the students of
			Shakespeare (as students go and if they are
			caught young enough) the habit of analysis is
			not only a possibility but a sleek, industrious,
			and complacent certainty.</p>

			<p>After a little furtive looking backward perhaps,
			and a few tremblings and doubts, they
			shall all be seen, almost to a man, offering
			their souls to Moloch, as though the not having
			a soul and not missing it were the one final
			and consummate triumph that literary culture
			could bring. Flocks of them can be seen with
			the shining in their faces year after year, term
			after term, almost anywhere on the civilised
			globe, doing this very thing—doing it under
			the impression that they are learning something,
			and not until the shining in their faces
			<a class="pagenum" id="page134" title="134"> </a>is gone will they be under the impression that
			they have learned it (whatever it is) and that
			they are educated.</p>

			<p>The fact that the analytic mind is establishing
			itself, in a greater or less degree, as the
			sentinel in college life of the entire creative
			literature of the world is a fact with many
			meanings in it. It means not only that there
			are a great many more minds like it in literature,
			but that a great many other minds—nearly
			all college-educated minds—are being
			made like it. It means that unless the danger
			is promptly faced and acted upon the next
			generation of American citizens can neither
			expect to be able to produce literature of its
			own nor to appreciate or enjoy literature that
			has been produced. It means that another
			eighteenth century is coming to the world;
			and, as the analysis is deeper than before and
			more deadly-clever with the deeper things than
			before, it is going to be the longest eighteenth
			century the world has ever seen—generations
			with machines for hands and feet, machines
			for minds, machines outside their minds to enjoy
			the machines inside their minds with.
			Every man with his information-machine to be
			cultured with, his religious machine to be good
			with, and his private Analysis Machine to be
			beautiful with, shall take his place in the
			world—shall add his soul to the Machine we
			make a world with. For every man that is
			born on the earth one more joy shall be crowded
			<a class="pagenum" id="page135" title="135"> </a>out of it—one more analysis of joy shall take
			its place, go round and round under the stars—dew,
			dawn, and darkness—until it stops.
			How a sunrise is made and why a cloud is
			artistic and how pines should be composed in
			a landscape, all men shall know. We shall
			criticise the technique of thunderstorms. “And
			what is a sunset after all?” The reflection of
			a large body on rarefied air. Through analysed
			heaven and over analysed fields it trails its
			joylessness around the earth.</p>

			<p>Time was, when the setting of the sun was
			the playing of two worlds upon a human being’s
			life on the edge of the little day, the
			blending of sense and spirit for him, earth and
			heaven, out in the still west. His whole being
			went forth to it. He watched with it and
			prayed and sang with it. In its presence his
			soul walked down to the stars. Out of the joy
			of his life, the finite sorrow and the struggle of
			his life, he gazed upon it. It was the portrait
			of his infinite self. Every setting sun that
			came to him was a compact with Eternal Joy.
			The Night itself—his figure faint before it in
			the flicker of the east—whispered to him:
			“Thou also—hills and heavens around thee,
			hills and heavens within thee—oh, Child of
			Time—Thou also art God!”</p>


			<p>“Ah me! How I could love! My soul doth
			melt,” cries Keats:</p>

			<div class="poem">
				<p>Ye deaf and senseless minutes of the day,</p>
				<p>And thou old forest, hold ye this for true,</p>
				<p><a class="pagenum" id="page136" title="136"> </a>There is no lightning, no authentic dew</p>
				<p>But in the eye of love; there’s not a sound,</p>
				<p>Melodious howsoever, can confound</p>
				<p>The heavens and the earth to such a death</p>
				<p>As doth the voice of love; there’s not a breath</p>
				<p>Will mingle kindly with the meadow air,</p>
				<p>Till it has panted round, and stolen a share</p>
				<p>Of passion from the heart.</p>
			</div>

			<p>John Keats and William Shakespeare wrote
			masterpieces because they had passions, spiritual
			experiences, and the daily habit of inspiration.
			In so far as these masterpieces are being
			truthfully taught, they are taught by teachers
			who themselves know the passion of creation.
			They teach John Keats and William Shakespeare
			by rousing the same passions and experiences
			in the pupil that Keats and Shakespeare
			had, and by daily appealing to them.</p>

			Analysis Analysed</h4>

			<p>There are a great many men in the world to-day,
			faithfully doing their stint in it (they are
			commonly known as men of talent), who would
			have been men of genius if they had dared.
			Education has made cowards of us all, and the
			habit of examining the roots of one’s instincts,
			before they come up, is an incurable habit.</p>

			<p>The essential principle in a true work of art
			is always the poem or the song that is hidden
			<a class="pagenum" id="page137" title="137"> </a>in it. A work of art by a man of talent is
			generally ranked by the fact that it is the
			work of a man who analyses a song before
			he sings it. He puts down the words of the
			song first—writes it, that is—in prose. Then
			he lumbers it over into poetry. Then he
			looks around for some music for it. Then he
			practises at singing it, and then he sings it.
			The man of genius, on the other hand, whether
			he be a great one or a very little one, is known
			by the fact that he has a song sent to him.
			He sings it. He has a habit of humming it
			over afterwards. His humming it over afterwards
			is his analysis. It is the only possible
			inspired analysis.</p>

			<p>The difference between these two types of
			men is so great that anything that the smaller
			of them has to say about the spirit or the processes
			of the other is of little value. When
			one of them tries to teach the work of the
			other, which is what almost always occurs,—the
			man of talent being the typical professor
			of works of genius,—the result is fatal.
			A singer who is so little capable of singing that
			he can give a prose analysis of his own song
			while it is coming to him and before he sings
			it, can hardly be expected to extemporise an
			inspired analysis of another man’s song after
			reading it. If a man cannot apply inspired
			analysis to a little common passion in a song
			he has of his own, he is placed in a hopeless
			position when he tries to give an inspired
			<a class="pagenum" id="page138" title="138"> </a>analysis of a passion that only another man
			could have and that only a great man would
			forget himself long enough to have.</p>

			<p>An inspired analysis may be defined as the
			kind of analysis that the real poet in his creatively
			critical mood is able to give to his work—a
			low-singing or humming analysis in which
			all the elements of the song are active and all
			the faculties and all the senses work on the
			subject at once. The proportions and relations
			of a living thing are all kept perfect in an inspired
			analysis, and the song is made perfect
			at last, not by being taken apart, but by being
			made to pass its delight more deeply and more
			slowly through the singer’s utmost self to its
			fulfilment.</p>

			<p>What is ordinarily taught as analysis is very
			different from this. It consists in the deliberate
			and triumphant separation of the faculties
			from one another and from the thing they have
			produced—the dull, bare, pitiless process of
			passing a living and beautiful thing before one
			vacant, staring faculty at a time. This faculty,
			being left in the stupor of being all by itself,
			sits in complacent judgment upon a work of
			art, the very essence of the life and beauty of
			which is its appealing to all of the faculties
			and senses at once, in their true proportion,
			glowing them together into a unit—namely,
			several things made into one thing, that is—several
			things occupying the same time and
			the same place, that is—synthesis. An inspired
			<a class="pagenum" id="page139" title="139"> </a>analysis is the rehearsal of a synthesis.
			An analysis is not inspired unless it comes as
			a flash of light and a burst of music and a
			breath of fragrance all in one. Such an analysis
			cannot be secured with painstaking and
			slowness, unless the painstaking and slowness
			are the rehearsal of a synthesis, and all the
			elements in it are laboured on and delighted in
			at once. It must be a low-singing or humming
			analysis.</p>

			<p>The expert student or teacher of poetry who
			makes “a dispassionate criticism” of a passion,
			who makes it his special boast that he is able
			to apply his intellect severely by itself to a
			great poem, boasts of the devastation of the
			highest power a human being can attain. The
			commonest man that lives, whatever his powers
			may be, if they are powers that act together,
			can look down on a man whose powers cannot,
			as a mutilated being. While it cannot be denied
			that a being who has been thus especially
			mutilated is often possessed of a certain literary
			ability, he belongs to the acrobats of literature
			rather than to literature itself. The contortionist
			who separates himself from his hands
			and feet for the delectation of audiences, the
			circus performer who makes a battering-ram of
			his head and who glories in being shot out of a
			cannon into space and amazement, goes through
			his motions with essentially the same pride in
			his strength, and sustains the same relation to
			the strength of the real man of the world.</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page140" title="140"> </a>Whatever a course of literary criticism may
			be, or its value may be, to the pupils who take
			it, it consists, more often than not, on the part
			of pupil and teacher both, in the dislocating of
			one faculty from all the others, and the bearing
			it down hard on a work of art, as if what it was
			made of, or how it was made, could only be
			seen by scratching it.</p>

			<p>It is to be expected now and then, in the
			hurry of the outside world, that a newspaper
			critic will be found writing a cerebellum criticism
			of a work of the imagination; but the
			student of literature, in the comparative quiet
			and leisure of the college atmosphere, who
			works in the same separated spirit, who estimates
			a work by dislocating his faculties on it,
			is infinitely more blameworthy; and the college
			teacher who teaches a work of genius by
			causing it to file before one of his faculties at a
			time, when all of them would not be enough,—who
			does this in the presence of young persons
			and trains them to do it themselves,—is a public
			menace. The attempt to master a masterpiece,
			as it were, by reading it first with the sense of
			sight, and then with the sense of smell, and
			with all the senses in turn, keeping them carefully
			guarded from their habit of sensing things
			together, is not only a self-destructive but a
			hopeless attempt. A great mind, even if it
			would attempt to master anything in this way,
			would find it hopeless, and the attempt to
			learn a great work of art—a great whole—by
			<a class="pagenum" id="page141" title="141"> </a>applying the small parts of a small mind to it,
			one after the other, is more hopeless still. It
			can be put down as a general principle that a
			human being who is so little alive that he finds
			his main pleasure in life in taking himself
			apart, can find little of value for others in a
			masterpiece—a work of art which is so much
			alive that it cannot be taken apart, and which
			is eternal because its secret is eternally its
			own. If the time ever comes when it can
			be taken apart, it will be done only by a man
			who could have put it together, who is more
			alive than the masterpiece is alive. Until the
			masterpiece meets with a master who is more
			creative than its first master was, the less the
			motions of analysis are gone through with by
			those who are not masters, the better. A
			masterpiece cannot be analysed by the cold and
			negative process of being taken apart. It can
			only be analysed by being melted down. It
			can only be melted down by a man who has
			creative heat in him to melt it down and the
			daily habit of glowing with creative heat.</p>

			<p>It is a matter of common observation that
			the fewer resources an artist has, the more
			things there are in nature and in the nature
			of life which he thinks are not beautiful. The
			making of an artist is his sense of selection.
			If he is an artist of the smaller type, he selects
			beautiful subjects—subjects with ready-made
			beauty in them. If he is an artist of the larger
			type, he can hardly miss making almost any
			<a class="pagenum" id="page142" title="142"> </a>subject beautiful, because he has so many
			beautiful things to put it with. He sees every
			subject the way it is—that is, in relation to a
			great many other subjects—the way God saw
			it, when He made it, and the way it is.</p>

			<p>The essential difference between a small
			mood and a large one is that in the small one
			we see each thing we look on, comparatively
			by itself, or with reference to one or two relations
			to persons and events. In our larger
			mood we see it less analytically. We see it as
			it is and as it lives and as a god would see it,
			playing its meaning through the whole created
			scheme into everything else.</p>

			<p>The soul of beauty is synthesis. In the
			presence of a mountain the sound of a hammer
			is as rich as a symphony. It is like the little
			word of a great man, great in its great relations.
			When the spirit is waked and the man within
			the man is listening to it, the sound of a hoof
			on a lonely road in the great woods is the
			footstep of cities to him coming through the
			trees, and the low, chocking sound of a cartwheel
			in the still and radiant valley throngs
			his being like an opera. All sights and echoes
			and thoughts and feelings revel in it. It is
			music for the smoke, rapt and beautiful, rising
			from the chimneys at his feet. A sheet of water—making
			heaven out of nothing—is beautiful
			to the dullest man, because he cannot analyse it,
			could not—even if he would—contrive to see it
			by itself. Skies come crowding on it. There
			<a class="pagenum" id="page143" title="143"> </a>is enough poetry in the mere angle of a sinking
			sun to flood the prose of a continent with, because
			the gentle earthlong shadows that follow
			it lay their fingers upon all life and creep together
			innumerable separated things.</p>

			<p>In the meadow where our birds are there is
			scarcely a tree in sight to tangle the singing in.
			It is a meadow with miles of sunlight in it. It
			seems like a kind of world-melody to walk in the
			height of noon there—infinite grass, infinite
			sky, gusts of bobolinks’ voices—it’s as if the air
			that drifted down made music of itself; and the
			song of all the singing everywhere—the song
			the soul hears—comes on the slow winds.</p>

			<p>Half the delight of a bobolink is that he is
			more synthetic, more of a poet, than other
			birds,—has a duet in his throat. He bursts
			from the grass and sings in bursts—plays his
			own obligato while he goes. One can never
			see him in his eager flurry, between his low
			heaven and his low nest, without catching the
			lilt of inspiration. Like the true poet, he suits
			the action to the word in a weary world, and
			does his flying and singing together. The song
			that he throws around him, is the very spirit of
			his wings—of all wings. More beauty is always
			the putting of more things together. They
			were created to be together. The spirit of art
			is the spirit that finds this out. Even the
			bobolink is cosmic, if he sings with room
			enough; and when the heart wakes, the song of
			the cricket is infinite. We hear it across stars.</p>

			Seeds and Blossoms</h4>

			<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">Four</span> men stood before God at the end of
			The First Week, watching Him whirl
			His little globe.<a href="#footnote_2" id="fnm2" title="Recently discovered manuscript." class="fnmarker">2</a> The first man said to Him,
			“Tell me how you did it.” The second man
			said, “Let me have it.” The third man said,
			“What is it for?” The fourth man said nothing,
			and fell down and worshipped. Having
			worshipped he rose to his feet and made a
			world himself.</p>

			<p>These four men have been known in history
			as the Scientist, the Man of Affairs, the Philosopher,
			and the Artist. They stand for the
			four necessary points of view in reading books.</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page145" title="145"> </a>Most of the readers of the world are content
			to be partitioned off, and having been duly set
			down for life in one or the other of these four
			divisions of human nature they take sides
			from beginning to end with one or the other
			of these four men. It is the distinction of the
			scholar of the highest class in every period,
			that he declines to do this. In so far as he
			finds each of the four men taking sides against
			each other, he takes sides against each of them
			in behalf of all. He insists on being able to
			absorb knowledge, to read and write in all four
			ways. If he is a man of genius as well as a
			scholar, he insists on being able to read and
			write, as a rule, in all four ways at once; if his
			genius is of the lesser kind, in two or three ways
			at once. The eternal books are those that
			stand this four-sided test. They are written
			from all of these points of view. They have
			absorbed into themselves the four moods of
			creation morning. It is thus that they bring
			the morning back to us.</p>

			<p>The most important question in regard to
			books that our schools and institutions of
			learning are obliged to face at present is,
			“How shall we produce conditions that will
			enable the ordinary man to keep the proportions
			that belong to a man, to absorb knowledge,
			to do his reading and writing in all four
			ways at once?” In other words, How shall
			we enable him to be a natural man, a man of
			genius as far as he goes?</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page146" title="146"> </a>A masterpiece is a book that can only be
			read by a man who is a master in some degree
			of the things the book is master of. The man
			who has mastered things the most is the man
			who can make those things. The man who
			makes things is the artist. He has bowed
			down and worshipped and he has arisen and
			stood before God and created before Him, and
			the spirit of the Creator is in him. To take
			the artist’s point of view, is to take the point
			of view that absorbs and sums up the others.
			The supremacy and comprehensiveness of this
			point of view is a matter of fact rather than
			argument. The artist is the man who makes
			the things that Science and Practical Affairs
			and Philosophy are merely about. The artist
			of the higher order is more scientific than the
			scientist, more practical than the man of
			affairs, and more philosophic than the philosopher,
			because he combines what these men do
			about things, and what these men say about
			things, into the things themselves, and makes
			the things live.</p>

			<p>To combine these four moods at once in
			one’s attitude toward an idea is to take the
			artist’s—that is, the creative—point of view toward
			it. The only fundamental outfit a man
			can have for reading books in all four ways
			at once is his ability to take the point of view
			of the man who made the book in all four
			ways at once, and feel the way he felt when he
			made it.</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page147" title="147"> </a>The organs that appreciate literature are the
			organs that made it. True reading is latent
			writing. The more one feels like writing a
			book when he reads it the more alive his reading
			is and the more alive the book is.</p>

			<p>The measure of culture is its originating and
			reproductive capacity, the amount of seed and
			blossom there is in it, the amount it can afford
			to throw away, and secure divine results. Unless
			the culture in books we are taking such
			national pains to acquire in the present generation
			can be said to have this pollen quality in
			it, unless it is contagious, can be summed up
			in its pollen and transmitted, unless it is nothing
			more or less than life itself made catching,
			unless, like all else that is allowed to have
			rights in nature, it has powers also, has an
			almost infinite power of self-multiplication,
			self-perpetuation, the more cultured we are
			the more emasculated we are. The vegetables
			of the earth and the flowers of the field—the
			very codfish of the sea become our superiors.
			What is more to the point, in the minds and
			interests of all living human beings, their
			culture crowds ours out.</p>

			<p>Nature may be somewhat coarse and simple-minded
			and naïve, but reproduction is her main
			point and she never misses it. Her prejudice
			against dead things is immutable. If a man
			objects to this prejudice against dead things,
			his only way of making himself count is to die.
			Nature uses such men over again, makes them
			<a class="pagenum" id="page148" title="148"> </a>into something more worth while, something
			terribly or beautifully alive,—and goes on her
			way.</p>

			<p>If this principle—namely, that the reproductive
			power of culture is the measure of its
			value—were as fully introduced and recognised
			in the world of books as it is in the world of
			commerce and in the natural world, it would
			revolutionise from top to bottom, and from
			entrance examination to diploma, the entire
			course of study, policy, and spirit of most of
			our educational institutions. Allowing for
			exceptions in every faculty—memorable to all
			of us who have been college students,—it would
			require a new corps of teachers.</p>

			<p>Entrance examinations for pupils and
			teachers alike would determine two points.
			First, what does this person know about
			things? Second, what is the condition of his
			organs—what can he do with them? If the
			privilege of being a pupil in the standard college
			were conditioned strictly upon the second
			of these questions—the condition of his organs—as
			well as upon the first, fifty out of a hundred
			pupils, as prepared at present, would fall
			short of admission. If the same test were applied
			for admission to the faculty, ninety out
			of a hundred teachers would fall short of admission.
			Having had analytic, self-destructive,
			learned habits for a longer time than
			their pupils, the condition of their organs is
			more hopeless.</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page149" title="149"> </a>The man who has the greatest joy in a symphony

			<p>Fifteenth, the Professional Critic—almost
			inevitably at the fifteenth remove from the
			heart of things because he is the least creative,
			unless he is a man of genius, or has pluck and
			talent enough to work his way through the
			<a class="pagenum" id="page150" title="150"> </a>other fourteen moods and sum them up before
			he ventures to criticise.</p>

			<p>The principles that have been employed in
			putting life into literature must be employed
			on drawing life out of it. These principles are
			the creative principles—principles of joy. All
			influences in education, family training, and a
			man’s life that tend to overawe, crowd out,
			and make impossible his own private, personal,
			daily habit of creative joy are the enemies of
			books.</p>

			Private Road: Dangerous</h4>

			<p>The impotence of the study of literature as
			practised in the schools and colleges of the
			present day turns largely on the fact that the
			principle of creative joy—of knowing through
			creative joy—is overlooked. The field of vision
			is the book and not the world. In the average
			course in literature the field is not even the
			book. It is still farther from the creative
			point of view. It is the book about the book.</p>

			<p>It is written generally in the laborious unreadable,
			well-read style—the book about the
			book. You are as one (when you are in the
			book about the book) thrust into the shadow
			of the endless aisles of Other Books—not that
			they are referred to baldly, or vulgarly, or in
			the text. It is worse than this (for this could
			<a class="pagenum" id="page151" title="151"> </a>be skipped). But you are surrounded helplessly.
			Invisible lexicons are on every page.
			Grammars and rhetorics, piled up in paragraphs
			and between the lines thrust at you
			everywhere. Hardly a chapter that does not
			convey its sense of struggling faithfulness, of
			infinite forlorn and empty plodding—and all
			for something a man might have known anyway.
			“I have toted a thousand books,” each
			chapter seems to say. “This one paragraph
			[page 1993—you feel it in the paragraph]
			has had to have forty-seven books carried to
			it.” Not once, except in loopholes in his reading
			which come now and then, does the face of
			the man’s soul peep forth. One does not expect
			to meet any one in the book about the
			book—not one’s self, not even the man who
			writes it, nor the man who writes the book that
			the book is about. One is confronted with a
			mob.</p>

			<p>Two things are apt to be true of students
			who study the great masters in courses employing
			the book about the book. Even if the
			books about the book are what they ought to
			be, the pupils of such courses find that (1)
			studying the master, instead of the things he
			mastered, they lose all power over the things
			he mastered; (2) they lose, consequently, not
			only the power of creating masterpieces out
			of these things themselves, but the power
			of enjoying those that have been created by
			others, of having the daily experiences that
			<a class="pagenum" id="page152" title="152"> </a>make such joy possible. They are out of
			range of experience. They are barricaded
			against life. Inasmuch as the creators of
			literature, without a single exception, have
			been more interested in life than in books,
			and have written books to help other people to
			be more interested in life than in books, this is
			the gravest possible defect. To be more interested
			in life than in books is the first essential
			for creating a book or for understanding one.</p>

			<p>The typical course of study now offered in
			literature carries on its process of paralysis in
			various ways:</p>

			<p>First. It undermines the imagination by
			giving it paper things instead of real ones to
			work on.</p>

			<p>Second. By seeing that these things are selected
			instead of letting the imagination select
			its own things—the essence of having an
			imagination.</p>

			<p>Third. By requiring of the student a rigorous
			and ceaselessly unimaginative habit. The
			paralysis of the learned is forced upon him.
			He finds little escape from the constant reading
			of books that have all the imagination left
			out of them.</p>

			<p>Fourth. By forcing the imagination to work
			so hard in its capacity of pack-horse and memory
			that it has no power left to go anywhere
			of itself.</p>

			<p>Fifth. By overawing individual initiative,
			undermining personality in the pupil, crowding
			<a class="pagenum" id="page153" title="153"> </a>great classics into him instead of attracting little
			ones out of him. Attracting little classics out of
			a man is a thing that great classics are always
			intended to do—the thing that they always
			succeed in doing when left to themselves.</p>

			<p>Sixth. The teacher of literature so-called,
			having succeeded in destroying the personality
			of the pupil, puts himself in front of the personality
			of the author.</p>

			<p>Seventh. A teacher who destroys personality
			in a pupil is the wrong personality to put in
			front of an author. If he were the right one,
			if he had the spirit of the author, his being in
			front, now and then at least, would be interpretation
			and inspiration. Not having the
			spirit of the author, he is intimidated by him,
			or has all he can do not to be. A classic cannot
			reveal itself to a groveller or to a critic.
			It is a book that was written standing up and
			it can only be studied and taught by those
			who stand up without knowing it. The decorous
			and beautiful despising of one’s self
			that the study of the classics has come to be as
			conducted under unclassic teachers, is a fact
			that speaks for itself.</p>

			<p>Eighth. Even if the personality of the
			teacher of literature is so fortunate as not to
			be the wrong one, there is not enough of it.
			There is hardly a course of literature that can
			be found in a college catalogue at the present
			time that does not base itself on the dictum
			that a great book can somehow—by some
			<a class="pagenum" id="page154" title="154"> </a>mysterious process—be taught by a small person.
			The axiom that necessarily undermines all
			such courses is obvious enough. A great book
			cannot be taught except by a teacher who is
			literally living in a great spirit, the spirit the
			great book lived in before it became a book,—a
			teacher who has the great book in him—not
			over him,—who, if he took time for it, might
			be capable of writing, in some sense at least, a
			great book himself. When the teacher is a
			teacher of this kind, teaches the spirit of what
			he teaches—that is, teaches the inside,—a
			classic can be taught.</p>

			<p>Otherwise the best course in literature that
			can be devised is the one that gives the masterpieces
			the most opportunity to teach themselves.
			The object of a course in literature is
			best served in proportion as the course is arranged
			and all associated studies are arranged
			in such a way as to secure sensitive and contagious
			conditions for the pupil’s mind in the
			presence of the great masters, such conditions
			as give the pupil time, freedom, space, and
			atmosphere—the things out of which a masterpiece
			is written and with which alone it can be
			taught, or can teach itself.</p>

			<p>All that comes between a masterpiece and
			its thus teaching itself, spreads ruin both
			ways. The masterpiece is partitioned off from
			the pupil, guarded to be kept aloof from him—outside
			of him. The pupil is locked up from
			himself—his possible self.</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page155" title="155"> </a>Not too much stress could possibly be laid
			upon intimacy with the great books or on the
			constant habit of living on them. They are
			the movable Olympus. All who create camp
			out between the heavens and the earth on them
			and breathe and live and climb upon them.
			From their mighty sides they look down on
			human life. But classics can only be taught
			by classics. The creative paralysis of pupils
			who have drudged most deeply in classical
			training—English or otherwise—is a fact that
			no observer of college life can overlook. The
			guilt for this state of affairs must be laid at
			the door of the classics or at the door of the
			teachers. Either the classics are not worth
			teaching or they are not being taught properly.</p>

			<p>In either case the best way out of the difficulty
			would seem to be for teachers to let the
			classics teach themselves, to furnish the students
			with the atmosphere, the conditions, the
			points of view in life, which will give the
			classics a chance to teach themselves.</p>

			<p>This brings us to the important fact that
			teachers of literature do not wish to create the
			atmosphere, the conditions, and points of view
			that give the classics a chance to teach themselves.
			Creating the atmosphere for a classic
			in the life of a student is harder than creating
			a classic. The more obvious and practicable
			course is to teach the classic—teach it one’s
			self, whether there is atmosphere or not.</p>

			<p>It is admitted that this is not the ideal way
			<a class="pagenum" id="page156" title="156"> </a>to do with college students who suppose they
			are studying literature, but it is contended—college
			students and college electives being
			what they are—that there is nothing else to
			do. The situation sums itself up in the attitude
			of self-defence. “It may be (as no one
			needs to point out), that the teaching of literature,
			as at present conducted in college, is a
			somewhat faithful and dogged farce, but whatever
			may be the faults of modern college-teaching
			in literature, it is as good as our pupils
			deserve.” In other words, the teachers are
			not respecting their pupils. It may be said to
			be the constitution and by-laws of the literature
			class (as generally conducted) that the
			teachers cannot and must not respect their
			pupils. They cannot afford to. It costs more
			than most pupils are mentally worth, it is
			plausibly contended, to furnish students in
			college with the conditions of life and the conditions
			in their own minds that will give masterpieces
			a fair chance at them. <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ergo</em>, inasmuch
			as the average pupil cannot be taught a
			classic he must be choked with it.</p>

			<p>The fact that the typical teacher of literature
			is more or less grudgingly engaged in doing
			his work and conducting his classes under the
			practical working theory that his pupils are
			not good enough for him, suggests two important
			principles.</p>

			<p>First. If his pupils are good enough for him,
			they are good enough to be taught the best
			<a class="pagenum" id="page157" title="157"> </a>there is in him, and they must be taught this
			best there is in him, as far as it goes, whether
			all of them are good enough for it or not.
			There is as much learning in watching others
			being educated as there is in appearing to be
			educated one’s self.</p>

			<p>Second. If his pupils are not good enough
			for him, the most literary thing he can do with
			them is to make them good enough. If he is
			not a sufficiently literary teacher to divine the
			central ganglion of interest in a pupil, and play
			upon it and gather delight about it and make
			it gather delight itself, the next most literary
			thing he can do is protect both the books and
			the pupil by keeping them faithfully apart until
			they are ready for one another.</p>

			<p>If the teacher cannot recognise, arouse, and
			exercise such organs as his pupil has, and
			carry them out into themselves, and free them
			in self-activity, the pupil may be unfortunate in
			not having a better teacher, but he is fortunate
			in having no better organs to be blundered on.</p>

			<p>The drawing out of a pupil’s first faint but
			honest and lasting power of really reading a
			book, of knowing what it is to be sensitive to
			a book, does not produce a very literary-looking
			result, of course, and it is hard to give the result
			an impressive or learned look in a catalogue,
			and it is a difficult thing to do without
			considering each pupil as a special human being
			by himself,—worthy of some attention on that
			account,—but it is the one upright, worthy,
			<a class="pagenum" id="page158" title="158"> </a>and beautiful thing a teacher can do. Any
			easier course he may choose to adopt in an institution
			of learning (even when it is taken helplessly
			or thoughtlessly as it generally is) is insincere
			and spectacular, a despising not only of the
			pupil but of the college public and of one’s self.</p>

			<p>If it is true that the right study of literature
			consists in exercising and opening out the human
			mind instead of making it a place for cold
			storage, it is not necessary to call attention to
			the essential pretentiousness and shoddiness of
			the average college course in literature. At
			its best—that is, if the pupils do not do the
			work, the study of literature in college is a
			sorry spectacle enough—a kind of huge girls’
			school with a chaperone taking its park walk.
			At its worst—that is, when the pupils do do
			the work, it is a sight that would break a
			Homer’s heart. If it were not for a few inspired
			and inconsistent teachers blessing particular
			schools and scholars here and there,
			doing a little guilty, furtive teaching, whether
			or no, discovering short-cuts, climbing fences,
			breaking through the fields, and walking on
			the grass, the whole modern scheme of elaborate,
			tireless, endless laboriousness would come
			to nothing, except the sight of larger piles of
			paper in the world, perhaps, and rows of dreary,
			dogged people with degrees lugging them back
			and forth in it,—one pile of paper to another
			pile of paper, and a general sense that something
			is being done.</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page159" title="159"> </a>In the meantime, human life around us,
			trudging along in its anger, sorrow, or bliss,
			wonders what this thing is that is being done,
			and has a vague and troubled respect for it;
			but it is to be noted that it buys and reads the
			books (and that it has always bought and read
			the books) of those who have not done it, and
			who are not doing it,—those who, standing in
			the spectacle of the universe, have been sensitive
			to it, have had a mighty love in it, or a
			mighty hate, or a true experience, and who
			have laughed and cried with it through the
			hearts of their brothers to the ends of the
			earth.</p>

			The Organs of Literature</h4>

			<p>The literary problem—the problem of possessing
			or appreciating or teaching a literary
			style—resolves itself at last into a pure problem
			of personality. A pupil is being trained in
			literature in proportion as his spiritual and
			physical powers are being brought out by the
			teacher and played upon until they permeate
			each other in all that he does and in all that
			he is—in all phases of his life. Unless what a
			pupil is glows to the finger tips of his words,
			he cannot write, and unless what he is makes
			the words of other men glow when he reads,
			he cannot read.</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page160" title="160"> </a>In proportion as it is great, literature is addressed
			to all of a man’s body and to all of his
			soul. It matters nothing how much a man
			may know about books, unless the pages of
			them play upon his senses while he reads, he
			is not physically a cultivated man, a gentleman,
			or scholar with his body. Unless books
			play upon all his spiritual and mental sensibilities
			when he reads he cannot be considered
			a cultivated man, a gentleman, and a scholar
			in his soul. It is the essence of all great
			literature that it makes its direct appeal to
			sense-perceptions permeated with spiritual suggestion.
			There is no such thing possible as
			being a literary authority, a cultured or scholarly
			man, unless the permeating of the sense-perceptions
			with spiritual suggestion is a daily
			and unconscious habit of life. “Every man
			his own poet” is the underlying assumption
			of every genuine work of art, and a work of
			art cannot be taught to a pupil in any other
			way than by making this same pupil a poet,
			by getting him to discover himself. Continued
			and unfaltering disaster is all that can be expected
			of all methods of literary training that
			do not recognise this.</p>

			<p>To teach a pupil all that can be known
			about a great poem is to take the poetry out
			of him, and to make the poem prose to him
			forever. A pupil cannot even be taught great
			prose except by making a poet of him, in his
			attitude toward it, and by so governing the
			<a class="pagenum" id="page161" title="161"> </a>conditions, excitements, duties, and habits of
			his course of study that he will discover he is
			a poet in spite of himself. The essence of
			Walter Pater’s essays cannot be taught to a
			pupil except by making a new creature of him
			in the presence of the things the essays are
			about. Unless the conditions of a pupil’s
			course are so governed, in college or otherwise,
			as to insure and develop the delicate and strong
			response of all his bodily senses, at the time of
			his life when nature decrees that his senses
			must be developed, that the spirit must be
			waked in them, or not at all, the study of
			Walter Pater will be in vain.</p>

			<p>The physical organisation, the mere bodily
			state of the pupil, necessary to appreciate either
			the form or the substance of a bit of writing
			like <cite>The Child in the House</cite>, is the first thing a
			true teacher is concerned with. A college
			graduate whose nostrils have not been trained
			for years,—steeped in the great, still delights
			of the ground,—who has not learned the spirit
			and fragrance of the soil beneath his feet, is not
			a sufficiently cultivated person to pronounce
			judgment either upon Walter Pater’s style or
			upon his definition of style.</p>

			<p>To be educated in the great literatures of
			the world is to be trained in the drawing out
			in one’s own body and mind of the physical
			and mental powers of those who write great
			literatures. Culture is the feeling of the induced
			current—the thrill of the lives of the
			<a class="pagenum" id="page162" title="162"> </a>dead—the charging the nerves of the body
			and powers of the spirit with the genius that
			has walked the earth before us. In the borrowed
			glories of the great for one swift and
			passing page we walk before heaven with
			them, breathe the long breath of the centuries
			with them, know the joy of the gods and live.
			The man of genius is the man who literally
			gives himself. He makes every man a man
			of genius for the time being. He exchanges
			souls with us and for one brief moment we are
			great, we are beautiful, we are immortal. We
			are visited with our possible selves. Literature
			is the transfiguring of the senses in which men
			are dwelling every day and of the thoughts of
			the mind in which they are living every day.
			It is the commingling of one’s life in one vast
			network of sensibility, communion, and eternal
			comradeship with all the joy and sorrow, taste,
			odor, and sound, passion of men and love of
			women and worship of God, that ever has been
			on the earth, since the watching of the first
			night above the earth, or since the look of the
			first morning on it, when it was loved for the
			first time by a human life.</p>

			<p>The artist is recognised as an artist in proportion
			as the senses of his body drift their
			glow and splendour over into the creations of
			his mind. He is an artist because his flesh is
			informed with the spirit, because in whatever
			he does he incarnates the spirit in the flesh.</p>

			<p>The gentle, stroking delight in this universe
			<a class="pagenum" id="page163" title="163"> </a>that Dr. Holmes took all his days, his contagious
			gladness in it and approval of it, his
			impressionableness to its moods—its Oliver-Wendell
			ones,—who really denies in his soul
			that this capacity of Dr. Holmes to enjoy, this
			delicate, ceaseless tasting with sense and spirit
			of the essence of life, was the very substance
			of his culture? The books that he wrote and
			the things that he knew were merely the form
			of it. His power of expression was the blending
			of sense and spirit in him, and because his
			mind was trained into the texture of his body
			people delighted in his words in form and spirit
			both.</p>

			<p>There is no training in the art of expression
			or study of those who know how to express,
			that shall not consist, not in a pupil’s knowing
			wherein the power of a book lies, but in his
			experiencing the power himself, in his entering
			the life behind the book and the habit of life
			that made writing such a book and reading it
			possible. This habit is the habit of incarnation.</p>

			<p>A true and classic book is always the history
			some human soul has had in its tent of flesh,
			camped out beneath the stars, groping for the
			thing they shine to us, trying to find a body
			for it. In the great wide plain of wonder there
			they sing the wonder a little time to us, if we
			listen. Then they pass on to it. Literature
			is but the faint echo tangled in thousands of
			years, of this mighty, lonely singing of theirs,
			<a class="pagenum" id="page164" title="164"> </a>under the Dome of Life, in the presence of the
			things that books are about. The power to
			read a great book is the power to glory in these
			things, and to use that glory every day to do
			one’s living and reading with. Knowing what
			is in the book may be called learning, but the
			test of culture always is that it will not be content
			with knowledge unless it is inward knowledge.
			Inward knowledge is the knowledge
			that comes to us from behind the book, from
			living for weeks with the author until his habits
			have become our habits, until God Himself,
			through days and nights and deeds and dreams,
			has blended our souls together.</p>

			Entrance Examinations in Joy</h4>

			<p>If entrance examinations in joy were required
			at our representative colleges very few
			of the pupils who are prepared for college in
			the ordinary way would be admitted. What is
			more serious than this, the honour-pupils in
			the colleges themselves at commencement time—those
			who have submitted most fully to the
			college requirements—would take a lower
			stand in a final examination in joy, whether
			of sense or spirit, than any others in the class.
			Their education has not consisted in the acquiring
			of a state of being, a condition of organs, a
			capacity of tasting life, of creating and sharing
			<a class="pagenum" id="page165" title="165"> </a>the joys and meanings in it. Their learning
			has largely consisted in the fact that they have
			learned at last to let their joys go. They have
			become the most satisfactory of scholars, not
			because of their power of knowing, but because
			of their willingness to be powerless in knowing.
			When they have been drilled to know without
			joy, have become the day-labourers of learning,
			they are given diplomas for cheerlessness,
			and are sent forth into the world as teachers of
			the young. Almost any morning, in almost
			any town or city beneath the sun, you can see
			them, Gentle Reader, with the children, spreading
			their tired minds and their tired bodies
			over all the fresh and buoyant knowledge of
			the earth. Knowledge that has not been
			throbbed in cannot be throbbed out. The
			graduates of the colleges for women (in The
			Association of Collegiate Alumnæ) have seriously
			discussed the question whether the college
			course in literature made them nearer or
			farther from creating literature themselves.
			The Editor of <cite>Harper’s Monthly</cite> has recorded
			that “the spontaneity and freedom of subjective
			construction” in certain American authors was
			only made possible, probably, by their having
			escaped an early academic training. The <cite>Century
			Magazine</cite> has been so struck with the fact
			that hardly a single writer of original power
			before the public has been a regular college
			graduate that it has offered special prizes and
			inducements for any form of creative literature—poem,
			<a class="pagenum" id="page166" title="166"> </a>story, or essay—that a college graduate
			could write.</p>

			<p>If a teacher of literature desires to remove
			his subject from the uncreative methods he
			finds in use around him, he can only do so
			successfully by persuading trustees and college
			presidents that literature is an art and that it
			can only be taught through the methods and
			spirit and conditions that belong to art. If he
			succeeds in persuading trustees and presidents,
			he will probably find that faculties are not persuaded,
			and that, in the typical Germanised
			institution of learning at least, any work he
			may choose to do in the spirit and method of
			joy will be looked upon by the larger part of
			his fellow teachers as superficial and pleasant.
			Those who do not feel that it is superficial and
			pleasant, who grant that working for a state
			of being is the most profound and worthy and
			strenuous work a teacher can do,—that it is
			what education is for,—will feel that it is impracticable.
			It is thus that it has come to pass
			in the average institution of learning, that if
			a teacher does not know what education is, he
			regards education as superficial, and if he does
			know what education is, he regards education
			as impossible.</p>

			<p>It is not intended to be dogmatic, but it may
			be worth while to state from the pupil’s point
			of view and from memory what kind of teacher
			a college student who is really interested in
			literature would like to have.</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page167" title="167"> </a>Given a teacher of literature who has <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">carte
			blanche</em> from the other teachers—the authorities
			around him—and from the trustees—the
			authorities over him,—what kind of a stand
			will he find it best to take, if he proposes to
			give his pupils an actual knowledge of literature?</p>

			<p>In the first place, he will stand on the general
			principle that if a pupil is to have an actual
			knowledge of literature as literature, he must
			experience literature as an art.</p>

			<p>In the second place, if he is to teach literature
			to his pupils as an art to be mastered, he
			will begin his teaching as a master. Instead
			of his pupils determining that they will elect
			him, he will elect them. If there is to be any
			candidating, he will see that the candidating
			is properly placed; that the privilege at least of
			the first-class music master, dancing master,
			and teacher of painting—the choosing of his
			own pupils—is accorded to him. Inasmuch as
			the power and value of his class must always
			depend upon him, he will not allow either the
			size or the character of his classes to be determined
			by a catalogue, or by the examinations
			of other persons, or by the advertising facilities
			of the college. If actual results are to be
			achieved in his pupils, it can only be by his
			governing the conditions of their work and by
			keeping these conditions at all times in his own
			hands.</p>

			<p>In the third place, he will see that his class
			<a class="pagenum" id="page168" title="168"> </a>is so conducted that out of a hundred who desire
			to belong to it the best ten only will be
			able to.</p>

			<p>In the fourth place, he will himself not only
			determine which are the best ten, but he will
			make this determination on the one basis possible
			for a teacher of art—the basis of mutual
			attraction among the pupils. He will take his
			stand on the spiritual principle that if classes
			are to be vital classes, it is not enough that the
			pupils should elect the teacher, but the teacher
			and pupils must elect each other. The basis
			of an art is the mutual attraction that exists
			between things that belong together. The
			basis for transmitting an art to other persons
			is the natural attraction that exists between
			persons that belong together. The more
			mutual the attraction is,—complementary or
			otherwise,—the more condensed and powerful
			teaching can it be made the conductor of.
			If a hundred candidates offer themselves, fifty
			will be rejected because the attraction is not
			mutual enough to insure swift and permanent
			results. Out of fifty, forty will be rejected
			probably for the sake of ten with whom the
			mutual attraction is so great that great things
			cannot help being accomplished by it.</p>

			<p>The thorough and contagious teacher of
			literature will hold his power—the power of
			conveying the current and mood of art to
			others—as a public trust. He owes it to the
			institution in which he is placed to refuse to
			<a class="pagenum" id="page169" title="169"> </a>surround himself with non-conductors; and
			inasmuch as his power—such as it is—is instinctive
			power, it will be placed where it instinctively
			counts the most. In proportion as
			he loves his art and loves his kind and desires
			to get them on speaking terms with each other,
			he will devote himself to selected pupils, to
			those with whom he will throw the least away.
			His service to others will be to give to these
			such real, inspired, and reproductive knowledge,
			that it shall pass on from them to others
			of its own inherent energy. From the narrower—that
			is, the less spiritual—point of view,
			it has seemed perhaps a selfish and aristocratic
			thing for a teacher to make distinctions in persons
			in the conduct of his work, but from the
			point of view of the progress of the world, it is
			heartless and sentimental to do otherwise; and
			without exception all of the most successful
			teachers in all of the arts have been successful
			quite as much through a kind of dictatorial insight
			in selecting the pupils they could teach,
			as in selecting the things they could teach
			them.</p>

			<p>In the fifth place, having determined to
			choose his pupils himself, the selection will be
			determined by processes of his own choosing.
			These processes, whatever form or lack of form
			they may take, will serve to convey to the
			teacher the main knowledge he desires. They
			will be an examination in the capacity of joy
			in the pupil. Inasmuch as surplus joy in a
			<a class="pagenum" id="page170" title="170"> </a>pupil is the most promising thing he can have,
			the sole secret of any ability he may ever attain
			of learning literature, the basis of all discipline,
			it will be the first thing the teacher takes into
			account. While it is obvious that an examination
			in joy could not be conducted in any set
			fashion, every great joy in the world has its
			natural diviners and experts, and teachers of
			literature who know its joy have plenty of
			ways of divining this joy in others.</p>

			<p>In the sixth place, pupils will be dropped
			and promoted by a teacher, in such a class as
			has been described, according to the spirit
			and force and creativeness of their daily work.
			Promotion will be by elimination—that is, the
			pupil will stay where he is and the class will
			be made smaller for him. The superior natural
			force of each pupil will have full sway in determining
			his share of the teacher’s force. As
			this force belongs most to those who waste it
			least, if five tenths of the appreciation in a
			class belongs to one pupil, five tenths of the
			teacher belongs to him, and promotion is most
			truly effected, not by giving the best pupils a
			new teacher, but by giving them more of the
			old one. A teacher’s work can only be successful
			in proportion as it is accurately individual
			and puts each pupil in the place he was
			made to fit.</p>

			<p>In the seventh place, the select class will be
			selected by the teacher as a baseball captain
			selects his team: not as being the nine best
			<a class="pagenum" id="page171" title="171"> </a>men, but as being the nine men who most call
			each other out, and make the best play together.
			If the teacher selects his class wisely,
			the principle of his selection sometimes—from
			the outside, at least—will seem no principle at
			all. The class must have its fool, for instance,
			and pupils must be selected for useful defects
			as well as for virtues. Belonging to such a
			class will not be allowed to have a stiff, definite,
			water-metre meaning in it, with regard to the
			capacity of a pupil. It will only be known
			that he is placed in the class for some quality,
			fault, or inspiration in him that can be brought
			to bear on the state of being in the class in
			such a way as to produce results, not only for
			himself but for all concerned.</p>

			Natural Selection in Theory</h4>

			<p>The conditions just stated as necessary for
			the vital teaching of literature narrow themselves
			down, for the most part, to the very
			simple and common principle of life and art,
			the principle of natural selection.</p>

			<p>As an item in current philosophy the principle
			of natural selection meets with general
			acceptance. It is one of those pleasant and
			instructive doctrines which, when applied to existing
			institutions, is opposed at once as a sensational,
			visionary, and revolutionary doctrine.</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page172" title="172"> </a>There are two most powerful objections to
			the doctrine of natural selection in education.
			One of these is the scholastic objection and the
			other is the religious one.</p>

			<p>The scholastic objection is that natural selection
			in education is impracticable. It cannot
			be made to operate mechanically, or for
			large numbers, and it interferes with nearly
			all of the educational machinery for hammering
			heads in rows, which we have at command
			at present. Even if the machinery could be
			stopped and natural selection could be given
			the place that belongs to it, all success in acting
			on it would call for hand-made teachers;
			and hand-made teachers are not being produced
			when we have nothing but machines to
			produce them with. The scholastic objection—that
			natural selection in education is impracticable
			under existing conditions—is obviously
			well taken. As it cannot be answered,
			it had best be taken, perhaps, as a recommendation.</p>

			<p>The religious objection to natural selection
			in education is not that it is impracticable, but
			that it is wicked. It rests its case on the defence
			of the weak.</p>

			<p>But the question at issue is not whether the
			weak shall be served and defended or whether
			they shall not. We all would serve and defend
			the weak. If a teacher feels that he can
			serve his inferior pupils best by making his
			superior pupils inferior too, it is probable that
			<a class="pagenum" id="page173" title="173"> </a>he had better do it, and that he will know how
			to do it, and that he will know how to do it
			better than any one else. There are many
			teachers, however, who have the instinctive
			belief, and who act on it so far as they are
			allowed to, that to take the stand that the inferior
			pupil must be defended at the expense
			of the superior pupil is to take a sentimental
			stand. It is not a stand in favour of the inferior
			pupil, but against him.</p>

			<p>The best way to respect an inferior pupil is
			to keep him in place. The more he is kept in
			place, the more his powers will be called upon.
			If he is in the place above him, he may see
			much that he would not see otherwise, much
			at which he will wonder, perhaps; but he deserves
			to be treated spiritually and thoroughly,
			to be kept where he will be creative, where his
			wondering will be to the point, both at once
			and eventually.</p>

			<p>It is a law that holds as good in the life of a
			teacher of literature as it does in the lives of
			makers of literature. From the point of view
			of the world at large, the author who can do
			anything else has no right to write for the
			average man. There are plenty of people who
			cannot help writing for him. Let them do it.
			It is their right and the world’s right that they
			should be the ones to do it. It is the place that
			belongs to them, and why should nearly every
			man we have of the more seeing kind to-day
			deliberately compete with men who cannot
			<a class="pagenum" id="page174" title="174"> </a>compete with him? The man who abandons
			the life that belongs to him,—the life that
			would not exist in the world if he did not live
			it and keep it existing in the world, and who
			does it to help his inferiors, does not help his
			inferiors. He becomes their rival. He crowds
			them out of their lives. There could not possibly
			be a more noble, or more exact and
			spiritual law of progress than this—that every
			man should take his place in human society
			and do his work in it with his nearest spiritual
			neighbours. These nearest spiritual neighbours
			are a part of the economy of the universe.
			They are now and always have been the natural
			conductors over the face of the earth of all
			actual power in it. It has been through the
			grouping of the nearest spiritual neighbours
			around the world that men have unfailingly
			found the heaven-appointed, world-remoulding
			teachers of every age.</p>

			<p>It does not sound very much like Thomas
			Jefferson,—and it is to be admitted that there
			are certain lines in our first great national
			document which, read on the run at least, may
			seem to deny it,—but the living spirit of
			Thomas Jefferson does not teach that amputation
			is progress, nor does true Democracy
			admit either the patriotism or the religion of
			a man who feels that his legs must be cut off
			to run to the assistance of neighbours whose
			legs are cut off. An educational Democracy
			which expects a pupil to be less than himself
			<a class="pagenum" id="page175" title="175"> </a>for the benefit of other pupils is a mock Democracy,
			and it is the very essence of a Democracy
			of the truer kind that it expects every
			man in it to be more than himself. And if a
			man’s religion is of the truer kind, it will not
			be heard telling him that he owes it to God
			and the Average Man to be less than himself.</p>

			Natural Selection in Practice</h4>

			<p>It is not going to be possible very much
			longer to take it for granted that natural selection
			is a somewhat absent-minded and heathen
			habit that God has fallen into in the natural
			world, and uses in his dealings with men, but
			that it is not a good enough law for men to
			use in their dealings with one another.</p>

			<p>The main thing that science has done in the
			last fifty years, in spite of conventional religion
			and so-called scholarship, has been to bring to
			pass in men a respect for the natural world.
			The next thing that is to be brought to pass—also
			in spite of conventional religion and so-called
			scholarship—is the self-respect of the
			natural man and of the instincts of human
			nature. The self-respect of the natural man,
			when once he gains it, is a thing that is bound
			to take care of itself, and take care of the man,
			and take care of everything that is important
			to the man.</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page176" title="176"> </a>Inasmuch as, in the long run at least, education,
			even in times of its not being human,
			interests humanity more than anything else, a
			most important consequence of the self-respect
			of the natural man is going to be an uprising,
			all over the world, of teachers who believe
			something. The most important consequence
			of having teachers who believe something will
			be a wholesale and uncompromising rearrangement
			of nearly all our systems and methods of
			education. Instead of being arranged to cow
			the teacher with routine, to keep teachers from
			being human beings, and to keep their pupils
			from finding it out if they are human beings,
			they will be arranged on the principle that the
			whole object of knowledge is the being of a
			human being, and the only way to know anything
			worth knowing in the world is to begin
			by knowing how to be a human being—and by
			liking it.</p>

			<p>Not until our current education is based
			throughout on expecting great things of human
			nature instead of secretly despising it, can it
			truly be called education. Expectancy is the
			very essence of education. Actions not only
			speak louder than words, they make words as
			though they were not; and so long as our
			teachers confine themselves to saying beautiful
			and literary things about the instincts of the
			human heart, and do not trust their own instincts
			in their daily teaching, and the instincts
			of their pupils, and do not make this trust the
			<a class="pagenum" id="page177" title="177"> </a>foundation of all their work, the more they
			educate the more they destroy. The destruction
			is both ways, and whatever the subjects
			are they may choose to know, murder and suicide
			are the branches they teach.</p>

			<p>The chief characteristic of the teacher of the
			future is going to be that he will dare to believe
			in himself, and that he will divine some one
			thing to believe in, in everybody else, and that,
			trusting the laws of human nature, he will go
			to work on this some one thing, and work out
			from it to everything. Inasmuch as the chief
			working principle of human nature is the principle
			of natural selection, the entire method
			of the teacher of the future will be based on
			his faith in natural selection. All such teaching
			as he attempts to do will be worked out
			from the temperamental, involuntary, primitive
			choices of his own being, both in persons and
			in subject. His power with his classes will be
			his power of divining the free and unconscious
			and primitive choices of individual pupils in
			persons and subjects.</p>

			<p>Half of the battle is already won. The
			principle of natural selection between pupils
			and subjects is recognised in the elective system,
			but we have barely commenced to conceive
			as yet the principle of natural selection
			in its more important application—mutual attraction
			between teacher and pupil—natural
			selection in its deeper and more powerful and
			spiritual sense: the kind of natural selection
			<a class="pagenum" id="page178" title="178"> </a>that makes the teacher a worker in wonder,
			and education the handiwork of God.</p>

			<p>In most of our great institutions we do not
			believe in even the theory of this deeper natural
			selection: and if we do believe in it, sitting in
			endowed chairs under the Umbrella of Endowed
			Ideas, how can we act on that belief? And if
			we do, who will come out and act with us? If
			it does not seem best for even the single teacher,
			doing his teaching unattached and quite by
			himself, to educate in the open,—to trust his
			own soul and the souls of his pupils to the
			nature of things, how much less shall the great
			institution, with its crowds of teachers and its
			rows of pupils and its Vested Funds be expected
			to lay itself open—lay its teachers and pupils
			and its Vested Funds open—to the nature of
			things? We are suspicious of the nature of
			things. God has concealed a lie in them. We
			do not believe. Therefore we cannot teach.</p>

			<p>The conclusion is inevitable. As long as we
			believe in natural selection between pupil and
			subject, but do not believe in natural selection
			between pupil and teacher, no great results in
			education or in teaching a vital relation to
			books or to anything else will be possible. As
			long as natural selection between pupil and
			teacher is secretly regarded as an irreligious
			and selfish instinct, with which a teacher must
			have nothing to do, instead of a divine ordinance,
			a Heaven-appointed starting-point for
			doing everything, the average routine teacher
			<a class="pagenum" id="page179" title="179"> </a>in the conventional school and college will continue
			to be the kind of teacher he is, and will
			continue to belong to what seems to many, at
			least, the sentimental and superstitious and
			pessimistic profession he belongs to now.
			Why should a teacher allow himself to teach
			without inspiration in the one profession on
			the earth where, between the love of God and
			the love of the opening faces, inspiration—one
			would say—could hardly be missed? Certainly,
			if it was ever intended that artists
			should be in the world it was intended that
			teachers should be artists. And why should
			we be artisans? If we cannot be artists, if we
			are not allowed to make our work a self-expression,
			were it not better to get one’s living
			by the labour of one’s hands,—by digging in
			the wonder of the ground? A stone-crusher,
			as long as one works one’s will with it, makes
			it say something, is nearer to nature than a
			college. “I would rather do manual labour
			with my hands than manual labour with my
			soul,” the true artist is saying to-day, and a
			great many thousand teachers are saying it,
			and thousands more who would like to teach.
			The moment that teaching ceases to be a trade
			and becomes a profession again, these thousands
			are going to crowd into it. Until the
			artist-teachers have been attracted to teaching,
			things can only continue as they are. Young
			men and women who are capable of teaching
			will continue to do all that they can not to get
			<a class="pagenum" id="page180" title="180"> </a>into it; and young men and women who are
			capable of teaching, and who are still trying to
			teach, will continue to do all that they can to
			get out of it. When the schools of America
			have all been obliged, like the city of Brooklyn,
			to advertise to secure even poor teachers, we
			shall begin to see where we stand,—stop our
			machinery a while and look at it.</p>

			<p>The only way out is the return to nature, and
			to faith in the freedom of nature. Not until
			the teacher of the young has dared to return
			to nature, has won the emancipation of his own
			instincts and the emancipation of the instincts
			of his pupils, can we expect anything better
			than we have now of either of them. Not until
			the modern teacher has come to the point where
			he deliberately works with his instincts, where
			he looks upon himself as an artist working in
			the subject that attracts him most, and in the
			material that is attracted to him most, can we
			expect to secure in our crowded conditions to-day
			enough teaching to go around. The one
			practical and economical way to make our
			limited supply of passion and thought cover
			the ground is to be spiritual and spontaneous
			and thorough with what we have. The one
			practical and economical way to do this is to
			leave things free, to let the natural forces in
			men’s lives find the places that belong to them,
			develop the powers that belong to them, until
			power in every man’s life shall be contagious
			of power. In the meantime, having brought
			<a class="pagenum" id="page181" title="181"> </a>out the true and vital energies of men as far as
			we go, if we are obliged to be specialists in
			knowledge we shall be specialists of the larger
			sort. The powers of each man, being actual
			and genuine powers, shall play into the powers
			of other men. Each man that essays to live
			shall create for us a splendour and beauty and
			strength he was made to create from the beginning
			of the world.</p>

			<p>To those who sit in the seat of the scornful
			the somewhat lyrical idea of an examination in
			joy as a basis of admission to the typical college
			appeals as a fit subject of laughter. So it is.
			Having admitted the laugh, the question is,—all
			human life is questioning the college to-day,—which
			way shall the laugh point?</p>

			<p>If the conditions of the typical college do not
			allow for the working of the laws of nature, so
			much the worse for the laws of nature, or so
			much the worse for the college. In the meantime,
			it is good to record that there are many
			signs—thanks to these same laws of nature—that
			a most powerful reaction is setting in, not
			only in the colleges themselves, but in all the
			forces of culture outside and around them.
			The examination in joy—the test of natural selection—is
			already employed by all celebrated
			music masters the world over in the choosing
			of pupils, and by all capable teachers of painting;
			and the time is not far off when, so far as
			courses in literature are concerned (if the
			teaching of literature is attempted in crowded
			<a class="pagenum" id="page182" title="182"> </a>institutions), the examination in joy will be the
			determining factor with all the best teachers,
			not only in the conduct of their classes, but in
			the very structure of them. Structure is the
			basis of conduct.</p>

			The Emancipation of the Teacher</h4>

			<p>The custom of mowing lawns in cities, of
			having every grass-blade in every door-yard
			like every other grass-blade, is considered by
			many persons as an artificial custom—a violation
			of the law of nature. It is contended that
			the free-swinging, wind-blown grasses of the
			fields are more beautiful and that they give
			more various and infinite delight in colour and
			line and movement. If a piece of this same
			field, however, could be carefully cut out and
			moved and fitted to a city door-yard—bobolinks
			and daisies and shadows and all, precisely as
			they are—it would not be beautiful. Long
			grass conforms to a law of nature where nature
			has room, and short grass conforms to a law of
			nature where nature has not room.</p>

			<p>When, for whatever reason, of whatever importance,
			men and women choose to be so close
			together, that it is not fitting they should have
			freedom, and when they choose to have so
			little room to live in that development is not
			fitting lest it should inconvenience others, the
			<a class="pagenum" id="page183" title="183"> </a>penalty follows. When grass-blades are
			crowded between walls and fences, the more
			they can be made to look alike the more pleasing
			they are, and when an acre of ground finds
			itself covered with a thousand people, or a
			teacher of culture finds himself mobbed with
			pupils, the law of nature is the same. Whenever
			crowding of any kind takes place, whether
			it be in grass, ideas, or human nature, the most
			pleasing as well as the most convenient and
			natural way of producing a beautiful effect is
			with the Lawn Mower. The dead level is the
			logic of crowded conditions. The city grades
			down its hills for the convenience of reducing
			its sewer problem. It makes its streets
			into blocks for the convenience of knowing
			where every home is, and how far it is, by a
			glance at a page, and, in order that the human
			beings in it (one set of innumerable nobodies
			hurrying to another set of innumerable nobodies)
			may never be made to turn out perchance
			for an elm on a sidewalk, it cuts down
			centuries of trees, and then, out of its modern
			improvements, its map of life, its woods in
			rows, its wheels on tracks, and its souls in
			pigeonholes—out of its huge Checker-board
			under the days and nights—it lifts its eyes to
			the smoke in heaven, at last, and thanks God
			it is civilised!</p>

			<p>The substantial fact in the case would seem
			to be that every human being born into the
			world has a right to be treated as a special
			<a class="pagenum" id="page184" title="184"> </a>creation all by himself. Society can only be
			said to be truly civilised in proportion as it
			acts on this fact. It is because in the family
			each being is treated as one out of six or seven,
			and in the school as one out of six hundred,
			that the family (with approximately good
			parents) comes nearer to being a model school
			than anything we have.</p>

			<p>If we deliberately prefer to live in crowds
			for the larger part of our lives, we must expect
			our lives to be cut and fitted accordingly. It
			is an æsthetic as well as a practical law that
			this should be so. The law of nature where
			there is room for a man to be a man is not the
			law of nature where there is not room for him
			to be a man. If there is no playground for his
			individual instincts except the street he must
			give them up. Inasmuch as natural selection
			in overcrowded conditions means selecting
			things by taking them away from others, it
			can be neither beautiful nor useful to practise
			it.</p>

			<p>People who prefer to be educated in masses
			must conform to the law of mass, which is inertia,
			and to the law of the herd, which is the
			Dog. As long as our prevailing idea of the
			best elective is the one with the largest class,
			and the prevailing idea of culture is the degree
			from the most crowded college, all natural gifts,
			whether in teachers or pupils, are under a
			penalty. If we deliberately place ourselves
			where everything is done by the gross, as a
			<a class="pagenum" id="page185" title="185"> </a>matter of course and in the nature of things
			the machine-made man, taught by the machine-made
			teacher, in a teaching-machine, will continue
			to be the typical scholar of the modern
			world; and the gentleman-scholar—the man
			who made himself, or who gave God a chance
			to make him—will continue to be what he is
			now in most of our large teaching communities—an
			exception.</p>

			<p>Culture which has not the power to win the
			emancipation of its teachers does not produce
			emancipated and powerful pupils. The essence
			of culture is selection, and the essence of selection
			is natural selection, and teachers who
			have not been educated with natural selection
			cannot teach with it. Teachers who have
			given up being individuals in the main activity
			of their lives, who are not allowed to be individuals
			in their teaching, do not train pupils to
			be individuals. Their pupils, instead of being
			organic human beings, are manufactured ones.
			Literary drill in college consists in drilling
			every man to be himself—in giving him the
			freedom of himself. Probably it would be admitted
			by most of us who are college graduates
			that the teachers who loom up in our lives
			are those whom we remember as emancipated
			teachers—men who dared to be individuals in
			their daily work, and who, every time they
			touched us, helped us to be individuals.</p>

			The Test of Culture</h4>

			<p>Looking at our great institutions of learning
			in a general way, one might be inclined to feel
			that literature cannot be taught in them, because
			the classes are too large. When one
			considers, however, the average class in literature,
			as it actually is, and the things that are
			being taught in it, it becomes obvious that the
			larger such a class can be made, and the less the
			pupil can be made to get out of it, the better.</p>

			<p>The best test of a man’s knowledge of the
			Spanish language would be to put him in
			a balloon and set him down in dark night
			in the middle of Spain and leave him there
			with his Spanish words. The best test of a
			man’s knowledge of books is to see what he
			can do without them on a desert island in the
			sea. When the ship’s library over the blue
			horizon dwindles at last in its cloud of smoke
			and he is left without a shred of printed paper
			by him, the supreme opportunity of education
			will come to him. He will learn how vital and
			beautiful, or boastful and empty, his education
			is. If it is true education, the first step he
			takes he will find a use for it. The first bird
			that floats from its tree-top shall be a message
			from London straight to his soul. If he has
			truly known them, the spirits of all his books
			will flock to him. If he has known Shakespeare,
			<a class="pagenum" id="page187" title="187"> </a>the ghost of the great master will rise
			from beneath its Stratford stone, and walk
			oceans to be with him. If he knows Homer,
			Homer is full of Odysseys trooping across the
			seas. Shall he sit him down on the rocks, lift
			his voice like a mere librarian, and, like a
			book-raised, paper-pampered, ink-hungry babe
			cry to the surf for a Greek dictionary? The
			rhythm of the beach is Greece to him, and the
			singing of the great Greek voice is on the tops
			of waves around the world.</p>

			<p>A man’s culture is his knowledge become
			himself. It is in the seeing of his eyes and the
			hearing of his ears and the use of his hands.
			Is there not always the altar of the heavens
			and the earth? Laying down days and nights
			of joy before it and of beauty and wonder and
			peace, the scholar is always a scholar, <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</em>, he
			is always at home. To be cultured is to be so
			splendidly wrought of body and soul as to get
			the most joy out of the least and the fewest
			things. Wherever he happens to be,—whatever
			he happens to be without,—his culture is
			his being master. He may be naked before
			the universe, and it may be a pitiless universe
			or a gracious one, but he is always master,
			knowing how to live in it, knowing how to
			hunger and die in it, or, like Stevenson, smiling
			out of his poor, worn body to it. He is the
			unconquerable man. Wherever he is in the
			world, he cannot be old in the presence of
			the pageant of Life. From behind the fading
			<a class="pagenum" id="page188" title="188"> </a>of his face lie watches it, child after child,
			spring after spring as it flies before him; he
			will not grow old while it still passes by.
			It carries delight across to him to the end.
			He watches and sings with it to the end, down
			to the edge of sleep.</p>

			<p>A bird’s shadow is enough to be happy with,

			continents.</p>

			<p>Literary training consists in the acquiring of
			a state of mind and body to feel the universe
			with; in becoming an athlete toward beauty, a
			giver of great lifts of joy to this poor, straining,
			stumbling world with its immemorial burden
			on its back, which, going round and round,

			infinities, is the hope and sorrow of all of us
			for the very reason that its eyes are shut.</p>

			Summary</h4>

			<p>The proper conditions for literary drill in
			college would seem to sum themselves up in
			<a class="pagenum" id="page189" title="189"> </a>the general idea that literature is the spirit of
			life. It can therefore only be taught through
			the spirit.</p>

			<p><em>First.</em> It can only be taught through the
			spirit by being taught as an art, through its
			own nature and activity, reproductively—giving
			the spirit body. Both the subject-matter
			and the method in true literary drill can only
			be based on the study of human experience.
			The intense study of human experience in a
			college course may be fairly said to involve
			three things that must be daily made possible
			to the pupil in college life. Everything that is
			given him to do, and everything that happens
			to him in college, should cultivate these three
			things in the pupil: (1) Personality—an intense
			first person singular, as a centre for
			having experience; (2) Imagination—the natural
			organ in the human soul for realising
			what an experience is and for combining and
			condensing it; (3) The habit of having time
			and room, for re-experiencing an experience at
			will in the imagination, until the experience
			becomes so powerful and vivid, so fully realises
			itself in the mind, that the owner of the mind
			is an artist with his mind. When he puts the
			experience of his mind down it becomes more
			real to other men on paper than their own experiences
			are to them in their own lives.</p>

			<p>It is hardly necessary to point out that whatever
			our conventional courses in literature may
			be doing, whether in college or anywhere else,
			<a class="pagenum" id="page190" title="190"> </a>they are not bringing out this creative joy and
			habit of creative joy in the pupils. Those who
			are interested in literature-courses—such as we
			have—for the most part do not believe in trying
			to bring out the creative joy of each pupil.
			Those who might believe in trying to do it
			do not believe it can be done. They do not
			believe it can be done because they do not
			realise that in the case of each and every pupil—so
			far as he goes—it is the only thing worth
			doing. They fail to see from behind their
			commentaries and from out of their footnotes,
			the fact that the one object in studying literature
			is joy, that the one way of studying and
			knowing literature is joy, and that the one
			way to attain joy is to draw out creative joy.</p>

			<p><em>Second.</em> And if literature is to be taught as
			an art it must be taught as a way of life. As
			long as literature and life continue to be conceived
			and taught as being separate things,
			there can be no wide and beautiful hope for
			either of them. The organs of literature are
			precisely the same organs and they are trained
			on precisely the same principles as the organs
			of life.</p>

			<p>Except an education in books can bring to
			pass the right condition of these organs, a
			state of being in the pupil, his knowledge of
			no matter how long a list of masterpieces is
			but a catalogue of the names of things for ever
			left out of his life. It is little wonder, when
			the drudgery has done its work and the sorry
			<a class="pagenum" id="page191" title="191"> </a>show is over, and the victim of the System is
			face to face with his empty soul at last, if in
			his earlier years at least he seems overfond to
			some of us of receiving medals, honours, and
			valedictories for what he might have been and
			of flourishing a Degree for what he has missed.</p>

			<div class="poem">
				<p>There was once a Master of Arts,</p>
				<p>Who was “nuts” upon cranberry tarts:</p>
				<p class="i2">When he’d eaten his fill</p>
				<p class="i2">He was awfully ill,</p>
				<p>But he was still a Master of Arts.</p>
			</div>

			<p>The power and habit of studying and enjoying
			human nature as it lives around us, is not
			only a more human and alive occupation, but
			it is a more literary one than becoming another
			editor of Æschylus or going down to posterity
			in footnotes as one of the most prominent bores
			that Shakespeare ever had. If a teacher of
			literature enjoys being the editor of Æschylus,
			or if he is happier in appearing on a title-page
			with a poet than he could possibly be in being
			a poet, it is personally well enough, though it
			may be a disaster to the rest of us and to
			Æschylus. Men who can be said as a class to
			care more about literature than they do about
			life, who prefer the paper side of things to the
			real one, are at liberty as private persons to be
			editors and footnote hunters to the top of their
			bent; but why should they call it “The Study
			of Literature,” to teach their pupils to be footnote
			hunters and editors? and how can they
			<a class="pagenum" id="page192" title="192"> </a>possibly teach anything else? and do they
			teach anything else? And if good teachers can
			only teach what they have, what shall we expect
			of poor ones?</p>

			<p>In the meantime the Manufacture of the
			Cultured Mind is going ruthlessly on, and
			thousands of young men and women who, left
			alone with the masters of literature, might be
			engaged in accumulating and multiplying inspiration,
			are engaged in analysing—dividing
			what inspiration they have; and, in the one
			natural, creative period of their lives, their
			time is entirely spent in learning how inspired
			work was done, or how it might have been
			done, or how it should have been done; in absorbing
			everything about it except its spirit—the
			power that did it—the power that makes
			being told how to do it uncalled for, the power
			that asks and answers its “Hows?” for itself.
			The serene powerlessness of it all, without
			courage or passion or conviction, without self-discovery
			in it, or self-forgetfulness or beauty
			in it, or for one moment the great contagion of
			the great, is one of the saddest sights in this
			modern day.</p>

			<p>In the meantime the most practical thing that
			can be done with the matter of literary drill in
			college is to turn the eye of the public on it.
			Methods will change when ideals change, and
			ideals will change when the public clearly sees
			ideals, and when the public encourages colleges
			that see them. The time is not far off when it
			<a class="pagenum" id="page193" title="193"> </a>will be admitted by all concerned that the
			true study of masterpieces consists, and always
			must consist, in communing with the things
			that masterpieces are about, in the learning
			and applying of the principles of human nature,
			in a passion for real persons, and in a daily
			loving of the face of the universe.</p>

			<p>This idea may not be considered very practical.
			It stands for a kind of education in which
			it is difficult to exhibit in rows actual results.
			We are not contending for an education that
			looks practical. We are contending merely
			for education that will be true and beautiful
			and natural. It will be practical the way the
			forces of nature are practical—whether any one
			notices it or not.</p>

			<p>The following announcement can already be
			seen on the bulletin boards of universities
			around the world(—if looked for twice).</p>

			<p><strong class="special_emphasis">They are Coming!</strong> O Shades of Learning,
			<strong class="special_emphasis">The Lovers of Joy, Imperious with

			A Note</h4>

			<p>It is one of the danger signs of the times that
			the men who have most closely observed our
			modern life, in its social, industrial, artistic,
			educational, and religious aspects seem to be
			gradually coming to the point where they all
			but take it for granted in considering all social,
			industrial, and educational and political questions,
			that the conditions of modern times are
			such, and are going to be such that imagination
			and personality might as well be dropped
			as practical forces—forces that must be reckoned
			with in the movement of human life.
			Nearly all the old-time outlooks of the Soul,
			as they stand in history, have been taken for
			factory sites, bought up by syndicates, moral
			and otherwise, and are being used for chimneys.
			<a class="pagenum" id="page195" title="195"> </a>Nothing but smoke and steel and
			wooden Things come out of them. Poets and
			brokers are both telling us on every hand that
			imagination is impossible and personality incredible
			in modern life.</p>

			<p>Imagination and personality are the spirit
			and the dust out of which all great nations and
			all great religions are made.</p>

			<p>The attempt has been made in the foregoing
			pages to point out that they are not dead.
			The Altar smoulders.</p>

			<p>In pointing out how imagination and personality
			can be wrought into one single branch
			of a man’s education—his relation to books—principles
			may have been suggested which can
			be concretely applied by all of us, each in
			our own department, to the education of the
			whole man.</p>

		Libraries. Wanted: An
		Old-Fashioned Librarian</h3>

		<div id="section_1.7.1" class="section">
			<h4 class="section_title"><abbr class="section_number" title="one">I</abbr><br/>
			viz.</h4>
			<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">I never</span> shall quite forget the time when
			the rumour was started in our town that
			old Mr. <span class="keep_together">M——</span>, our librarian—a gentle, furtive,
			silent man—a man who (with the single
			exception of a long white beard) was all
			screwed up and bent around with learning,
			who was always slipping invisibly in and out
			of his high shelves, and who looked as if his
			whole life had been nothing but a kind of
			long, perpetual salaam to books—had been
			caught dancing one day with his wife.</p>

			<p>“Which only goes to show,” broke in The
			<a class="pagenum" id="page197" title="197"> </a>M. P., “what a man of fixed literary habits—mere
			book-habits—if he keeps on, is reduced
			to.”</p>

			<p>But as I was about to remark, for a good
			many weeks afterward—after the rumour was
			started—one kept seeing people (I was one of
			them) as they came into the library, looking
			shyly at Mr. <span class="keep_together">M——</span>, as if they were looking at
			him all over again. They looked at him as
			if they had really never quite noticed him before.
			He sat at his desk, quiet and busy, and
			bent over, with his fine-pointed pen and his
			labels, as usual, and his big leather-bound
			catalogue of the universe.</p>

			<p>A few of us had had reason to suspect—at
			least we had had hopes—that the pedantry in
			Mr. <span class="keep_together">M——</span> was somewhat superimposed, that
			he had possibilities, human and otherwise, but
			none of us, it must be confessed, had been able
			to surmise quite accurately just where they
			would break out. We were filled with a gentle
			spreading joy with the very thought of it, a
			sense of having acquired a secret possession in
			a librarian. The community at large, however,
			as it walked into its library, looked at its
			Acre of Books, and then looked at its librarian;
			felt cheated. It was shocked. The community
			had always been proud of its books, proud
			of its Book Worm. It had always paid a big
			salary to it. And the Worm had turned.</p>

			<p>I have only been back to the old town twice
			since the day I left it, as a boy—about this
			<a class="pagenum" id="page198" title="198"> </a>time. The first time I went he was there. I
			came across him in his big, splendid new
			library, his face like some live, but wrinkled
			old parchment, twinkling and human though—looking
			out from its Dust Heap. “It seems
			to me,” I thought, as I stood in the doorway,—saw
			him edging around an alcove in The
			Syriac Department,—“that if one must have a
			great dreary heaped-up pile of books in a town—anyway—the
			spectacle of a man like this,
			flitting around in it, doting on them, is what
			one ought to have to go with it.” He always
			seemed to me a kind of responsive every-way-at-once
			little man, book-alive all through.
			One never missed it with him. He had the
			literary nerves of ten dead nations tingling
			in him.</p>

			<p>The next time I was in town they said he
			had resigned. They said he lived in the little
			grey house around the corner from the great
			new glaring stone library. No one ever saw
			him except in one of his long, hesitating walks,
			or sometimes, perhaps, by the little study window,
			pouring himself over into a book there.
			It was there that I saw him myself that last
			morning—older and closer to the light turning
			leaves—the same still, swift eagerness about
			him.</p>

			<p>I stepped into the library next door and saw
			the new librarian—an efficient person. He
			seemed to know what time it was while we
			stood and chatted together. That is the main
			<a class="pagenum" id="page199" title="199"> </a>impression one had of him—that he would
			always know what time it was. Put him anywhere.
			One felt it.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="section_1.7.2" class="section">
			<h4 class="section_title"><abbr class="section_number" title="two">II</abbr><br/>
			cf.</h4>
			<p>Our new librarian troubles me a good deal.
			I have not quite made out why. Perhaps it is
			because he has a kind of chipper air with the
			books. I am always coming across him in the
			shelves, but I do not seem to get used to him.
			Of course I pull myself together, bow and say
			things, make it a point to assume he is literary,
			go through the form of not letting him
			know what I think as well as may be, but we
			do not get on.</p>

			<p>And yet all the time down underneath I
			know perfectly well that there is no real reason
			why I should find fault with him. The only
			thing that seems to be the matter with him is
			that he keeps right on, every time I see him,
			making me try to.</p>

			<p>I have had occasion to notice that, as a general
			rule, when I find myself finding fault with
			a man in this fashion—this vague, eager
			fashion—the gist of it is that I merely want
			him to be some one else. But in this case—well,
			he is some one else. He is almost anybody
			else. He might be a head salesman in a
			department store, or a hotel clerk, or a train
			<a class="pagenum" id="page200" title="200"> </a>dispatcher, or a broker, or a treasurer of something.
			There are thousands of things he might
			be—ought to be—except our librarian. He
			has an odd, displaced look behind the great
			desk. He looks as if he had gotten in by mistake
			and was trying to make the most of it.
			He has a business-like, worldly-minded, foreign
			air about him—a kind of off-hand, pert, familiar
			way with books. He does not know how
			to bend over—like a librarian—and when one
			comes on him in an alcove, the way one ought
			to come on a librarian, with a great folio on
			his knees, he is—well, there are those who
			think, that have seen it, that he is positively
			comic. I followed him around only the other
			day for fifteen or twenty minutes, from one
			alcove to another, and watched him taking
			down books. He does not even know how to
			take down a book. He takes all the books
			down alike—the same pleasant, dapper, capable
			manner, the same peek and clap for all of
			them. He always seems to have the same indefatigable
			unconsciousness about him, going
			up and down his long aisles, no more idea of
			what he is about or of what the books are
			about; everything about him seems disconnected
			with a library. I find I cannot get myself
			to notice him as a librarian or comrade, or
			book-mind. He does not seem to have noticed
			himself in this capacity—exactly. So far as I
			can get at his mind at all, he seems to have
			decided that his mind (any librarian’s mind) is
			<a class="pagenum" id="page201" title="201"> </a>a kind of pneumatic-tube, or carrier system—apparently—for
			shoving immortals at people.
			Any higher or more thorough use for a mind,
			such as being a kind of spirit of the books for
			people, making a kind of spiritual connection
			with them down underneath, does not seem to
			have occurred to him.</p>

			<p>Time was when librarians really had something
			to do with books. They looked it. One
			could almost tell a librarian on the street—tell
			him at sight, if he had been one long enough.
			One could feel a library in a man somehow. It
			struck in. Librarians were allowed to be persons.
			It was expected of them. They have
			not always been what so many of them are
			now—mere couplings, conveniences, connecting-rods,
			literary-beltings. They were identified—wrought
			in with books. They could not
			be unmixed. They ate books; and, like the
			little green caterpillars that eat green grass,
			the colour showed through. A sort of general
			brown, faded colour, a little undusted around
			the edges, was the proper colour for librarians.</p>

			<p>It is true that people did not expect librarians
			to look quite human—at least on the outside,
			sometimes, and doubtless the whole matter was
			carried too far. But it does seem to me it is
			some comfort (if one has to have a librarian
			in a library) to have one that goes with the
			books—same colour, tone, feeling, spirit, and
			everything—the kind of librarian that slips in
			and out among books without being noticed
			<a class="pagenum" id="page202" title="202"> </a>there, one way or the other, like the overtone
			in a symphony.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="section_1.7.3" class="section">
			<h4 class="section_title"><abbr class="section_number" title="three">III</abbr><br/>
			et al.</h4>
			<p>But the trouble with our library is not merely
			the new librarian, who permeates, penetrates,
			and ramifies the whole library within and
			without, percolating efficiency into its farthest
			and loneliest alcoves. Our new librarian has
			a corps of assistants. And even if you manage,
			by slipping around a little, to get over to
			where a book is, alone, and get settled down
			with it, there is always some one who is, has
			been, or will be looking over your shoulder.</p>

			<p>I dare say it’s a defect of temperament—this
			having one’s shoulder looked over in libraries.
			Other people do not seem to be troubled much,
			and I suppose I ought to admit, while I am
			about it, that having one’s shoulder looked
			over in a library does not in the least depend
			upon any one’s actually looking over it. That
			is merely a matter of form. It is a little hard
			to express it. What one feels—at least in our
			library—is that one is in a kind of side-looking
			place. One feels a kind of literary detective
			system going silently on in and out all around
			one, a polite, absent-minded-looking watchfulness.</p>

			<p>Now I am not for one moment flattering
			<a class="pagenum" id="page203" title="203"> </a>myself that I can make my fault-finding with
			our librarian’s assistants amount to much—fill
			out a blank with it.</p>

			<p>No one can feel more strongly than I do my
			failure to put my finger on the letter of our
			librarian’s faults. I cannot even tell the difference
			between the faults and the virtues of
			our librarian’s assistants. Either by doing the
			right thing with the wrong spirit, or the wrong
			thing with the right spirit they do their faults
			and virtues all up together. Their indefatigable
			unobtrusiveness, their kindly, faithful
			service I both dread and appreciate. I have
			tried my utmost to notice and emphasise every
			day the pleasant things about them, but I
			always get tangled up. I have started out to
			think with approval, for instance, of the hush,—the
			hush that clothes them as a garment,—but
			it has all ended in my merely wondering
			where they got it and what they thought they
			were doing with it. One would think that a
			hush—a hush of almost any kind—could hardly
			help—but I have said enough. I do not want
			to seem censorious, but if ever there was a
			visible, unctuous, tangible, actual thick silence,
			a silence that can be proved, if ever there was a
			silence that stood up and flourished and swung
			its hat, that silence is in our library. The way
			our librarian’s assistants go tiptoeing and reverberating
			around the room—well—it’s one
			of those things that follow a man always, follow
			his inmost being all his life. It gets in
			<a class="pagenum" id="page204" title="204"> </a>with the books—after a few years or so. One
			can feel the tiptoeing going on in a book—one
			of our library books—when one gets home with
			it. It is the spirit of the place. Everything
			that comes out of it is followed and tiptoed
			around by our librarian’s assistants’ silence.
			They are followed about by it themselves. The
			thick little blonde one, with the high yellow
			hair, lives in our ward. One feels a kind of
			hush rimming her around, when one meets her
			on the street.</p>

			<p>Now I do not wish to claim that librarians’
			assistants can possibly be blamed, in so many
			words, either for this, or for any of the other
			things that seem to make them (in our library,
			at least) more prominent than the books.
			Everything in a library seems to depend upon
			something in it that cannot be put into words.
			It seems to be a kind of spirit. If the spirit is
			the wrong spirit, not all the librarians in the
			world, not even the books themselves can do
			anything about it.</p>

			<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

			<p class="post_thoughtbreak">Postscript. I do hope that no one will suppose
			from this chapter that I am finding fault
			or think I am finding fault with our assistant
			librarians. I am merely finding fault with them
			(may Heaven forgive them!) because I cannot.
			It doesn’t seem to make very much difference—their
			doing certain things or not doing them.
			They either do them or they don’t do them—whichever
			it is—with the same spirit. They
			<a class="pagenum" id="page205" title="205"> </a>are not really down in their hearts true to the
			books. One can hardly help feeling vaguely,
			persistently resentful over having them about
			presiding over the past. One never catches
			them—at least I never do—forgetting themselves.
			One never comes on one loving a book.
			They seem to be servants,—most of them,—book
			chambermaids. They do not care anything
			about a library as a library. They just
			seem to be going around remembering rules
			in it.</p>

			etc.</h4>

			<p>The P. G. S. of M. as good as said the other
			day, when I had been trying as well as I could
			to express something of this kind, that the real
			trouble with the modern library was not with
			the modern library, but with me. He thought
			I tried to carry too many likes and dislikes
			around with me, that I was too sensitive. He
			seemed to think that I should learn to be callous
			in places of public resort.</p>

			<p>I said I had no very violent dislikes to deal
			with. The only thing I could think of that
			was the matter with me in a library was that I
			had a passion for books. I didn’t like climbing
			over a barricade of catalogues to get to
			books. I hated to feel partitioned off from
			them, to stand and watch rows of people marking
			things between me and books. I thought
			<a class="pagenum" id="page206" title="206"> </a>that things had come to a pretty pass, if a man
			could not so much as touch elbows with a poet
			nowadays—with Plato, for instance—without
			carrying a redoubt of terrible beautiful young
			ladies. I said I thought a great many other
			people felt the way I did. I admitted there
			were other sides to it, but there were times, I
			said, when it almost seemed to me that this
			spontaneous uprising in our country—this
			movement of the Book Lovers, for instance—was
			simply a struggle on the part of the people
			to get away from Mr. Carnegie’s libraries.
			They are hemming literature and human
			nature in, on every side, or they are going to
			unless Mr. Carnegie can buy up occasional
			old-fashioned librarians—some other kind than
			are turned out in steel works—to put into
			them. Libraries are getting to be huge Separators.
			Books that have been put through
			libraries are separated from themselves. They
			are depersonalised—the human nature all taken
			off. And yet when one thinks of it, with nine
			people out of ten—the best people and the
			worst both—the sense of having a personal relation
			to a book, the sense of snuggling up
			with one’s own little life to a book, is what
			books are for.</p>

			<p>“To a man,” I said, “to whom books are
			people, and the livest kind of people, brothers
			of his own flesh, cronies of his life, the whole
			business of getting a book in a library is full
			of resentment and rebellion. He finds his
			<a class="pagenum" id="page207" title="207"> </a>rights, or what he thinks are his rights, being
			treated as privileges, his most sacred and confidential
			relations, his relations with the great,
			meddled with by strangers—pleasant enough
			strangers, but still strangers. Perhaps he
			wishes to see John Milton. He goes down town
			to a great unhomelike-looking building, and
			slides in at the door. He steps up to a wall,
			and asks permission to see John Milton. He
			waits in a kind of vague, unsatisfied fashion,
			but he feels that machinery is being set in
			motion. While it is being set in motion, he
			sits down before the wall on one of the seats or
			pews where a large audience of other comfortless
			and lonely-looking people are. He feels
			the great, heartless building gathering itself
			together, going after John Milton for him,
			while he sits and waits. One after the other
			he hears human beings’ names being called out
			in space, and one by one poor scared-looking
			people who seem to be ashamed to go with
			their names—most of them—step up before
			the audience. He sees a book being swung
			out to them, watches them slink gratefully
			away, and finally his own name echoing about
			among the Immortals, startles its way down
			to him. Then he steps up to the wall again,
			and John Milton at last, as on some huge
			transcendental derrick belonging to the city of <span class="keep_together">——,</span> is
			swung into his arms. He feels of the
			outside gropingly—takes it home. If he can
			get John Milton to come to life again after all
			<a class="pagenum" id="page208" title="208"> </a>this, he communes with him. In two weeks
			he takes him back. Then the derrick again.”</p>

			<p>The only kind of book that I ever feel close
			to, in the average library, is a book on war.
			Even if I go in, in a gentle, harmless, happy,
			singing sort of way, thinking I want a volume
			of pastoral poems, by the time I get it, I wish
			it were something that could be loaded, or that
			would go off. As for asking for a book and
			reading it in cold blood right in the middle of
			such a place, it will always be beyond me. I
			have never found a book I could do it with
			yet. However I struggle to follow the train
			of thought in it, it ‘s a fuse. I find myself
			breaking out, when I see all these far-away-looking
			people coming up in rows to their faraway
			books. “A library,” I say to myself,
			“is a huge barbaric, mediæval institution,
			where behind stone and glass a man’s dearest
			friends in the world, the familiars of his life,
			lie helpless in their cells. It is the Penitentiary
			of Immortals. There are certain visiting
			days when friends and relatives are allowed to
			come, but it only—” At this point a gong
			sounds and tells me to go home. “Are not
			books bone of a man’s bone, and flesh of his
			flesh? Oughtn’t they to be? Shall a man
			ask permission to see his wife? Why should
			I fill out a slip to a pretty girl, when I want to
			be in Greece with Homer, or go to hell with
			Dante? Why should I write on a piece of
			paper, ‘I promise to return—infinity—by six
			<a class="pagenum" id="page209" title="209"> </a>o’clock’? A library is a huge machine for
			keeping the letter with books and violating
			their spirit. The fact that the machinery is
			filled with a mirage of pleasant faces does not
			help. Pleasant faces make machinery worse—if
			they are a part of it. They make one
			expect something better.”</p>

			<p>The P. G. S. of M. wished me to understand
			at this point that I was not made right, that I
			was incapable, helpless in a library, that I did
			not seem to know what to do unless I could
			have a simple, natural, or country relation to
			books.</p>

			<p>“It doesn’t follow,” he said, “because you
			are bashful in a library, cannot get your mind
			to work there, with other people around, that
			the other people oughtn’t to be around.
			There are a great many ways of using a
			library, and the more people there are crowded
			in with the books there, other things being
			equal, the better. It’s what a library is for,” he
			said, and a great deal more to the same effect.</p>

			<p>I listened a while and told him that I supposed
			he was right. I supposed I had naturally
			a kind of wild mind. I allowed that the
			more a library in a general way took after a
			piece of woods, the more I enjoyed it. I did
			not attempt to deny that a library was made
			for the people, but I did think there ought to
			be places in libraries—all libraries—where wild
			ones, like me, could go. There ought to be in
			every library some uncultivated, uncatalogued,
			<a class="pagenum" id="page210" title="210"> </a>unlibrarianed tract where a man with a skittish
			or country mind will have a chance, where a
			man who likes to be alone with books—with
			books just as books—will be permitted to
			browze, unnoticed, bars all down, and frisk
			with his mind and roll himself, without turning
			over all of a sudden only to find a librarian’s
			assistant standing there wondering at him,
			looking down to the bottom of his soul.</p>

			<p>I am not in the least denying that librarians
			are well enough,—that is, might be well
			enough,—but as things are going to-day, they
			all seem to contribute, somehow, toward making
			a library a conscious and stilted place.
			They hold one up to the surface of things, with
			books. They make impossible to a man those
			freedoms of the spirit—those best times of all
			in a library, when one feels free to find one’s
			mood, when one gets hold of one’s divining-rod,
			opens down into a book, discovers a new,
			unconscious, subterranean self there.</p>

			<p>The P. G. S. of M. broke in at this point and
			said this was all subjective folderol on my part—that
			I had better drop it—a kind of habit I
			had gotten into lately, of splitting the hairs of
			my emotions—or something to that effect. He
			went on at some length and took the general
			ground before he was through, that absolutely
			everything in modern libraries depended on
			the librarians. Librarians—I should judge—in
			a modern library were what books were for.
			He said that the more intelligent people were
			<a class="pagenum" id="page211" title="211"> </a>nowadays the more they enjoyed librarians—knew
			how to use them—doted on them, etc.,
			<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad infinitum</em>.</p>

			<p>“The kind of people one sees at operas,” I
			interrupted, “listening with librettos, the kind
			of people who puff up mountains to see views
			and extract geography from them, the people
			one meets in the fields, nowadays, flower in
			one hand, botany in the other, the kind of
			people who have to have charts to enjoy stars
			with—these are the people who want librarians
			between them and their books. The more librarians
			they can get standing in a row between
			them and a masterpiece the more they feel
			they are appreciating it, the more card catalogues,
			gazetteers, dictionaries, derricks, and
			other machinery they can have pulling and
			hauling above their heads in a library the more
			literary they feel in it. They feel culture—somehow—stirring
			around them. They are
			not exactly sure what culture is, but they feel
			that a great deal of it—whatever it is—is being
			poured over into them.”</p>

			<p>But I must begin to bring these wanderings
			about libraries to a close. It can do no harm to
			remark, perhaps, that I am not maintaining—do
			not wish to maintain (I could not if I dared)
			that the modern librarian with all his faults
			is not useful at times. As a sort of pianola
			or æolian attachment for a library, as a mechanical
			contrivance for making a comparatively
			ignorant man draw perfectly enormous
			<a class="pagenum" id="page212" title="212"> </a>harmonies out of it (which he does not care
			anything about), a modern librarian helps.
			All that I am maintaining is, that I am not
			this comparatively ignorant man. I am another
			one. I am merely saying that the pianola way
			of dealing with ignorance, in my own case, up
			to the present at least, does not grow on me.</p>

			O</h4>

			<p>I suppose that the Boston Public Library
			would say—if it said anything—that I had a
			mere Old Athenæum kind of a mind. I am
			obliged to confess that I dote on the Old
			Athenæum. It protects one’s optimism. One
			is made to feel there—let right down in the
			midst of civilisation, within a stone’s throw of
			the State House—that it is barely possible to
			keep civilisation off. One feels it rolling itself
			along, heaping itself up out on Tremont Street
			and the Common (the very trees cannot live in
			it), but one is out of reach. When one has to
			live in civilisation, as most of us do, nearly all
			of one’s time every day in the week, it means
			a great deal. I can hardly say how much it
			means to me, in the daily struggle with it, to
			be able to dodge behind the Athenæum, to be
			able to go in and sit down there, if only for a
			minute, to be behind glass, as it were, to hear
			great, hungry Tremont Street chewing men
			<a class="pagenum" id="page213" title="213"> </a>up, hundreds of trainloads at a time, into wood-pulp,
			smoothing them out into nobody or
			everybody; it makes one feel, while it is not
			as it ought to be, as if, after all, there might
			be some way out, as if some provision had been
			made in this world, or might be made, for letting
			human beings live on it.</p>

			<p>The general sense of unsensitiveness in a
			modern library, of hurry and rush and efficiency,
			above all, the kind of moral smugness
			one feels there, the book-self-consciousness,
			the unprotected, public-street feeling one has—all
			these things are very grave and important
			obstacles which our great librarians, with their
			great systems—most of them—have yet to
			reckon with. A little more mustiness, gentlemen,
			please, silence, slowness, solitude with
			books, as if they were woods, unattainableness
			(and oh, will any one understand it?), a little
			inconvenience, a little old-fashioned, happy
			inconvenience; a chance to gloat and take
			pains and love things with difficulties, a chance
			to go around the corners of one’s knowledge,
			to make modest discoveries all by one’s self.
			It is no small thing to go about a library having
			books happen to one, to feel one’s self
			sitting down with a book—one’s own private
			Providence—turning the pages of events.</p>

			<p>One cannot help feeling that if a part of the
			money that is being spent carnegieing nowadays,
			that is, in arranging for a great many
			books and a great many people to pile up order
			<a class="pagenum" id="page214" title="214"> </a>among a great many books, could be spent in
			providing hundreds of thousands of small libraries,
			or small places in large ones, where men
			who would like to do it would feel safe to creep
			in sometimes and open their souls—nobody
			looking—it would be no more than fair.</p>

			<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

			<p class="post_thoughtbreak">Postscript. One has to be so much of one’s
			time helpless before a librarian in this world,
			one has to put him on his honour as a gentleman
			so much, to expose such vast, incredible
			tracts of ignorance to him, that I know only too
			well that I, of all men, cannot afford, in these
			pages or anywhere else, to say anything that
			will permanently offend librarians. I do hope I
			have not. It is only through knowing so many
			good ones that I know enough to criticise the
			rest. If I am right, it is because I am their
			spokesman. If I am wrong, I am not a well-informed
			person, and I do not count anywhere
			in particular on anything. The best way, I
			suspect, for a librarian to deal with me is not
			to try to classify me. I ought to be put out
			of the way on this subject, tucked back into
			any general pigeon-hole of odds and ends of
			temperament. If I had not felt that I could
			be cheerfully sorted out at the end of this
			page, filed away by everybody,—almost anybody,—as
			not making very much difference, I
			would not have spoken so freely. There is not
			a librarian who has read as far as this, in this
			book, who, though he may have had moments
			<a class="pagenum" id="page215" title="215"> </a>of being troubled in it, will not be able to dispose
			of me with a kind of grateful, relieved
			certainty. However that may be, I can only
			beg you, Oh, librarians, and all ye kindly
			learned ones, to be generous with me, wherever
			you put me. I leave my poor, naked, shivering,
			miscellaneous soul in your hands.</p>

		The Issue</h4>

		<p class="first_paragraph">I dreamed I lived in a day when men
		dared have visions. I lay in a great white
		Silence as one who waited for something.</p>

		<p>And as I lay and waited, the Silence groped
		toward me and I felt it gathering nearer and
		nearer about me.</p>

		<p>Then it folded me to Itself.</p>

		<p>I made Time my bedside.</p>

		<p>And it seemed to me, when I had rested my
		soul with years, and when I had found Space
		and had stretched myself upon it, I awoke.</p>

		<p>I lay in a great white empty place, and the
		whole world like solemn music came to me.</p>

		<p>And I looked, and behold in the shadow of
		the earth, which came and went, I saw Human
		Lives being tossed about. On the solemn
		rhythmic music, back and forth, I saw them
		lifted across Silence.</p>

		<p>And I said to my Spirit, “What is it they
		are doing?”</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page220" title="220"> </a>“They are living,” the Spirit said.</p>

		<p>So they floated before me while The Great
		Shadow came and went.</p>

		<p class="dotbreak">••••••••</p>

		<p>“O my Soul, hast thou forgotten thy days
		in the world, when thou didst watch the processional
		of it, when the faces—day-lighted,
		night-lighted, faces—trooped before thee, and
		thou didst look upon them and delight in
		them? What didst thou see in the world?”</p>

		<p>“I saw Two Immeasurable Hands in it,”
		said my Soul, “over every man. I saw that
		the man did not see the Hands. I saw that
		they reached out of infinity for him down
		through the days and the nights. And
		whether he slept or prayed or wrought, I saw
		that they still reached out for him, and folded
		themselves about him.”</p>

		<p>And I asked God what The Hands were.</p>

		<p>“The man calls them Heredity and Environment,”
		God said.</p>

		<p>And God laughed.</p>

		<p>Words came from far for me and waited in
		tumult within me. But my mouth was filled
		with silence.</p>

		<p class="dotbreak">••••••••</p>

		<p>I know that I do not know the world, but
		out of my little corner of time and space I have
		watched in it,—watched men and truths struggling
		in it, and in the struggle it has seemed
		to me I have seen three kinds of men. I have
		<a class="pagenum" id="page221" title="221"> </a>seen the man who feels that he is being made,
		and the man who feels that he is making himself.
		But I have seen also another kind of
		man—the man who feels that the Universe is
		at work on him, but (within limits) under his
		own supervision.</p>

		<p>I have made a compact in my soul with this
		man, for a new world. He is not willing to
		be a mere manufactured man—one more being
		turned out from The Factory of Circumstance—neither
		does he think very much of the man
		who makes himself—who could make himself.
		If he were to try such a thing—try to make a
		man himself, he would really rather try it, if
		the truth must be told, on some one else.</p>

		<p>As near as he can define it, life seems to be
		(to the normal or inspired man) a kind of alternate
		grasping and being grasped. Sometimes
		he feels his destiny tossed between the Two
		Immeasurable Hands. Sometimes he feels
		that they have paused—that the Immeasurable
		Hands have been lent to him, that the toss of
		destiny is made his own.</p>

		<p>He watches these two great forces playing
		under heaven, before his eyes, with his immortal
		life, every day. His soul takes these
		powers of heaven, as the mariner takes the
		winds of the sea. He tacks to destiny. He
		takes the same attitude toward the laws of
		heredity and environment that the Creator
		took when He made them. He takes it for
		granted that a God who made these laws as
		<a class="pagenum" id="page222" title="222"> </a>conveniences for Himself, in running a Universe,
		must have intended them for men as
		conveniences in living in it. In proportion as
		men have been like God they have treated
		these laws as He does—as conveniences.
		Thousands of men are doing it to-day. Men
		did it for thousands of years before they knew
		what the laws were, when they merely followed
		their instincts with them. In a man’s
		answer to the question, How can I make a
		convenience of the law of heredity and environment?—education
		before being born and education
		after being born—will be found to lie
		always the secret glory or the secret shame of
		his life.</p>
	</div>
	<div id="section_2.1.2" class="section">
		<h4 class="section_title"><abbr class="section_number" title="two">II</abbr><br/>
		The First Selection</h4>

		<p>If the souls of the unborn could go about
		reconnoitering the earth a little before they
		settled on it, selecting the parents they would
		have, the places where it pleased them to be
		born, nine out of ten of them (judging from
		the way they conduct themselves in the flesh)
		would spend nearly all their time in looking
		for the best house and street to be born in,
		the best things to be born to. Such a little
		matter as selecting the right parents would be
		left, probably, to the last moment, or they
		would expect it to be thrown in.</p>

		<p>We are all of us more or less aware, especially
		<a class="pagenum" id="page223" title="223"> </a>as we advance in life, that overlooking
		the importance of parents is a mistake.
		There have been times in the lives of some of
		us when having parents at all seemed a mistake.
		We can remember hours when we were
		sure we had the wrong ones. After our first disappointment,—that
		is, when we have learned
		how unmanageable parents are,—we have our
		time—most of us—of making comparisons, of
		trying other people’s parents on. This cannot
		be said to work very well, taken as a whole,
		and it is generally admitted that people who
		are most serious about it, who take unto themselves
		fathers- and mothers-in-law seldom do
		any better than at first. The conclusion of the
		whole matter would seem to be: Since a man
		cannot select his parents and his parents cannot
		select him, he must select himself.
		That is what books are for.</p>
	</div>
	<div id="section_2.1.3" class="section">
		<h4 class="section_title"><abbr class="section_number" title="three">III</abbr><br/>
		Conveniences</h4>

		<p>It is the first importance of a true book that
		a man can select his neighbours with it,—can
		overcome space, riches, poverty, and time with
		it,—and the grave, and break bread with the
		dead. A book is a portable miracle. It
		makes a man’s native place all over for him,
		for a dollar and a quarter; and many a man in
		this somewhat hard and despairing world has
		<a class="pagenum" id="page224" title="224"> </a>been furnished with a new heaven and a new
		earth for twenty-five cents. Out of a public
		library he has felt reached down to him the
		grasp of heroes. Hurrying home in the night,
		perhaps, with his tiny life hid under stars,
		but with a Book under his arm, he has felt a
		Greeting against his breast and held it tight.
		“Who art thou, my lad?” it said; “who art
		thou?” And the saying was not forgotten.
		If it is true that the spirits of the mighty dead
		are abroad in the night they are turning the
		leaves of books.</p>

		<p>There are other inspiring things in the
		world, but there is nothing else that carries
		itself among the sons of men like the book.
		With such divine plenteousness—seeds of the
		worlds in it—it goes about flocking on the
		souls of men. There is something so broadcast,
		so universal about the way of a book with
		a man: boundless, subtle, ceaseless, irresistible,
		following him and loving him, renewing him,
		delighting in him and hoping for him—like a
		god. It is as the way of Nature herself with
		a man. One cannot always feel it, but somehow,
		when I am really living a real day, I feel
		as if some Great Book were around me—were
		always around me. I feel myself all-enfolded,
		penetrated, surrounded with it—the vast,
		gentle force of it—sky and earth of it. It is as
		if I saw it, sometimes, building new boundaries
		for me, out there—softly, gently, on the edges
		of the night—for me and for all human life.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page225" title="225"> </a>Other inspiring things seem to be less steadfast
		for us. They cannot always free themselves
		and then come and free us. Music
		cannot be depended upon. It sings sometimes
		for and sometimes against us. Sometimes,
		also, music is still—absolutely still, all the way
		down from the stars to the grass. At best it is
		for some people and for others not, and is addicted
		to places. It is a part of the air—part
		of the climate in Germany, but there is but
		one country in the world made for listening in—where
		any one, every one listens, the way
		one breathes. The great pictures inspire, on
		the whole, but few people—most of them with
		tickets. Cathedrals cannot be unmoored, have
		never been seen by the majority of men at
		all, except in dreams and photographs. Most
		mountains (for all practical purposes) are
		private property. The sea (a look at the
		middle of it) is controlled by two or three
		syndicates. The sky—the last stronghold of
		freedom—is rented out for the most part,
		where most men live—in cities; and in New
		York and London the people who can afford
		it pay taxes for air, and grass is a dollar a
		blade. Being born is the only really free thing—and
		dying. Next to these in any just estimate
		of the comparatively free raw material
		that goes to the making of a human life comes
		the printed book.</p>

		<p>A library, on the whole, is the purest and
		most perfect form of power that exists, because
		<a class="pagenum" id="page226" title="226"> </a>it is a lever on the nature of things. If a man
		is born with the wrong neighbours it brings
		the right ones flocking to him. It is the universe
		to order. It makes the world like a
		globe in a child’s hands. He turns up the
		part where he chooses to live—now one way
		and now another, that he may delight in it and
		live in it. If he is a poet it is the meaning of
		life to him that he can keep on turning it until
		he has delighted and tasted and lived in all of it.</p>

		<p>The second importance of true books is that
		they are not satisfied with the first. They are
		not satisfied to be used to influence a man from
		the outside—as a kind of house-furnishing for
		his soul. A true book is never a mere contrivance
		for arranging the right bit of sky for
		a man to live his life under, or the right neighbours
		for him to live his life with. It goes
		deeper than this. A mere playing upon a
		man’s environment does not seem to satisfy a
		true book. It plays upon the latent infinity
		in the man himself. The majority of men are
		not merely conceived in sin and born in lies,
		but they are the lies; and lies as well as truths
		flow in their veins. Lies hold their souls back
		thousands of years. When one considers the
		actual facts about most men, the law of environment
		seems a clumsy and superficial law
		enough. If all that a book can do is to appeal
		to the law of environment for a man, it does
		not do very much. The very trees and stones
		do better for him, and the little birds in their
		<a class="pagenum" id="page227" title="227"> </a>nests. No possible amount of environment
		crowded on their frail souls would ever make
		it possible for most men to catch up—to overtake
		enough truth before they die to make
		their seventy years worth while. The majority
		of men (one hardly dares to deny) can be seen,
		sooner or later, drifting down to death either
		bitterly or indifferently. The shadows of their
		lives haunt us a little, then they vanish away
		from us and from the sound of our voices.
		Oh, God, from behind Thy high heaven—from
		out of Thy infinite wealth of years, hast Thou
		but the one same pittance of threescore and
		ten for every man? Some of us are born with
		the handicap of a thousand years woven in the
		nerves of our bodies, the swiftness of our
		minds, and the delights of our limbs. Others
		of us are born with the thousand years binding
		us down to blindness and hobbling, holding us
		back to disease, but all with the same Imperious
		Timepiece held above us, to run the same
		race, to overtake the same truth—before the
		iron curtain and the dark. Some of us—a few
		men in every generation—have two or three
		hundred years given to us outright the day we
		are born. Then we are given seventy more.
		Others of us have two hundred years taken
		away from us the day we are born. Then we
		are given seventy years to make them up in,
		and it is called life.</p>

		<p>If we are to shut ourselves up with one law,
		either the law of environment or the law of
		<a class="pagenum" id="page228" title="228"> </a>heredity, it is obvious that the best a logical
		man could do, would be to be ashamed of a
		universe like this and creep out of it as soon as
		he could. The great glory of a great book is,
		that it will not let itself be limited to the law
		of environment in dealing with a man. It
		deals directly with the man himself. It appeals
		to the law of heredity. It reaches down
		into the infinite depth of his life. If a man
		has started a life with parents he had better
		not have (for all practical purposes), it furnishes
		him with better ones. It picks and
		chooses in behalf of his life out of his very
		grandfathers, for him. It not only supplies
		him with a new set of neighbours as often as
		he wants them. It sees that he is born again
		every morning on the wide earth and that he
		has a new set of parents to be born to. It is
		a part of the infinite and irrepressible hopefulness
		of this mortal life that each man of us who
		dwells on the earth is the child of an infinite
		marriage. We are all equipped, even the
		poorest of us, from the day we begin, with an
		infinite number of fathers and an infinite number
		of mothers—no telling, as we travel down
		the years, which shall happen to us next. If
		what we call heredity were a matter of a few
		months,—a narrow, pitiful, two-parent affair,—if
		the fate of a human being could be shut in
		with what one man and one woman, playing
		and working, eating and drinking, under
		heaven, for a score of years or more, would
		<a class="pagenum" id="page229" title="229"> </a>be likely to have to give him from out of their
		very selves, heredity would certainly be a
		whimsical, unjust, undignified law to come
		into a world by, to don an immortal soul
		with. A man who has had his life so recklessly
		begun for him could hardly be blamed
		for being reckless with it afterward. But it
		is not true that the principle of heredity in a
		human life can be confined to a single accident
		in it. We are all infinite, and our
		very accidents are infinite. In the very flesh
		and bones of our bodies we are infinite—brought
		from the furthest reaches of eternity
		and the utmost bounds of created life to be
		ourselves. If we were to do nothing else for
		threescore years, it is not in our human breath
		to recite our fathers’ names upon our lips.
		Each of us is the child of an infinite mother,
		and from her breast, veiled in a thousand years,
		we draw life, glory, sorrow, sleep, and death.
		The ones we call fathers and mothers are but
		ambassadors to us—delegates from a million
		graves—appointed for our birth. Every boy is
		a summed-up multitude. The infinite crowd
		of his fathers beckons for him. As in some
		vast amphitheatre he lives his life, before the
		innumerable audience of the dead—each from
		its circle of centuries—calls to him, contends
		for him, draws him to himself.</p>

		<p>Inasmuch as every man who is born in the
		world is born with an infinite outfit for living
		in it, it is the office of all books that are true and
		<a class="pagenum" id="page230" title="230"> </a>beautiful books—true to the spirit of a man—that
		they shall play upon the latent infinity in
		him; that they shall help him to select his
		largest self; that they shall help him to give,
		as the years go on, the right accent to the right
		fathers, in his life.</p>

		<p>Books are more close to the latent infinity in
		a human being than anything else can be, because
		the habit of the infinite is their habit.
		As books are more independent of space and
		time than all other known forces in the lives
		of men, they seem to make all the men who
		love them independent also. If a man has not
		room for his life, he takes a book and makes
		room for it. When the habit of books becomes
		the habit of a man he unhands himself at will
		from space and time; he finds the universe is
		his universe. He finds ancestors and neighbours
		alike flocking to him—doing his bidding.
		God Himself says “Yes” to him and delights
		in him. He has entered into conspiracy with
		the nature of things. He does not feel that he
		is being made. He does not feel that he is
		making himself. The universe is at work on
		him—under his own supervision.</p>

		The Charter of Possibility</h4>

		<p>In reading to select one’s parents and one’s
		self, there seem to be two instincts involved.
		<a class="pagenum" id="page231" title="231"> </a>These instincts may vary more or less according
		to the book and the mood of the reader, but
		the object of all live reading—of every live experience
		with a book—is the satisfying of one
		or both of them. A man whose reading means
		something to him is either letting himself go
		in a book or letting himself come in it. He is
		either reading himself out or reading himself
		in. It is as if every human life were a kind
		of port on the edge of the universe, when
		it reads,—possible selves outward-bound
		and inward-bound trooping before It. Some
		of these selves are exports and some are imports.</p>

		<p>If the principle of selection is conceived in a
		large enough spirit, and is set in operation soon
		enough, and is continued long enough, there is
		not a child that can be born on the earth who
		shall not be able to determine by the use of
		books, in the course of the years, what manner
		of man he shall be. He may not be able to
		determine how soon he shall be that man, or
		how much of that man shall be fulfilled in himself
		before he dies, and how much of him shall
		be left over to be fulfilled in his children, but
		the fact remains that to an extraordinary degree,
		through a live use of books, not only a
		man’s education after he is born, but his education
		before he is born, is placed in his hands.
		It is the supreme office of books that they do
		this; that they place the laws of heredity and
		environment where a man with a determined
		<a class="pagenum" id="page232" title="232"> </a>spirit can do something besides cringing to
		them. Neither environment nor heredity—taken
		by itself—can give a man a determined
		spirit, but it is everything to know that, given
		a few books and the determined spirit both, a
		man can have any environment he wants for
		living his life, and his own assorted ancestors
		for living it. It is only by means of books
		that a man can keep from living a partitioned-off
		life in the world—can keep toned up to the
		divine sense of possibility in it. We hear great
		men every day, across space and time, halloaing
		to one another in books, and across all
		things, as we feel and read, is the call of our
		possible selves. Even the impossible has been
		achieved, books tell us, in history, again and
		again. It has been achieved by several men.
		This may not prove very much, but if it does
		not prove anything else, it proves that the
		possible, at least, is the privilege of the rest
		of us. It has its greeting for every man. The
		sense of the possible crowds around him, and
		not merely in his books nor merely in his life,
		but in the place where his life and books meet—in
		his soul. However or wherever a man
		may be placed, it is the great book that reminds
		him Who he is. It reminds him who
		his Neighbour is. It is his charter of possibility.
		Having seen, he acts on what he sees,
		and reads himself out and reads himself in
		accordingly.</p>

		The Great Game</h4>

		<p>It would be hard to say which is the more
		important, reading for exports or imports,
		reading one’s self out or reading one’s self in,
		but inasmuch as the importance of reading one’s
		self out is more generally overlooked, it may
		be well to dwell upon it. Most of the reading
		theories of the best people to-day, judging
		from the prohibitions of certain books, overlook
		the importance altogether, in vital and normal
		persons—especially the young,—of reading
		one’s self out. It is only as some people keep
		themselves read out, and read out regularly,
		that they can be kept from bringing evil on the
		rest of us. If Eve had had a novel, she would
		have sat down under the Tree and read about
		the fruit instead of eating it. If Adam had
		had a morning paper, he would hardly have
		listened to his wife’s suggestion. If the Evil
		One had come up to Eve in the middle of <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les
		Miserables</cite>, or one of Rossetti’s sonnets, no one
		would ever have heard of him. The main misfortune
		of Adam and Eve was that they had
		no arts to come to the rescue of their religion.
		If Eve could have painted the apple, she would
		not have eaten it. She put it into her mouth
		because she could not think of anything else
		to do with it, and she had to do something.
		She had the artistic temperament (inherited
		<a class="pagenum" id="page234" title="234"> </a>from her mother Sleep, probably, or from being
		born in a dream), and the temptation of the
		artistic temperament is, that it gets itself expressed
		or breaks something. She had tried
		everything—flowers, birds, clouds, and her
		shadow in the stream, but she found they were
		all inexpressible. She could not express them.
		She could not even express herself. Taking
		walks in Paradise and talking with the one
		man the place afforded was not a complete and
		satisfying self-expression. Adam had his limitations—like
		all men. There were things that
		could not be said.</p>

		<p>Standing as we do on the present height of
		history, with all the resources of sympathy in
		the modern world, its countless arts drawing
		the sexes together, going about understanding
		people, communing with them, and expressing
		them, making a community for every man,
		even in his solitude, it is not hard to see that
		the comparative failure of the first marriage
		was a matter of course. The real trouble was
		that Adam and Eve, standing in their brand-new
		world, could not express themselves to
		one another. As there was nothing else to
		express them, they were bored. It is to Eve’s
		credit that she was more bored than Adam
		was, and that she resented it more; and while
		a Fall, under the circumstances, was as painful
		as it was inevitable, and a rather extreme
		measure on Eve’s part, no one will deny that
		it afforded relief on the main point. It seems
		<a class="pagenum" id="page235" title="235"> </a>to be the universal instinct of all Eve’s sons
		and daughters that have followed since, that an
		expressive world is better than a dull one.
		An expressive world is a world in which all
		the men and women are getting themselves
		expressed, either in their experiences or in
		their arts—that is, in other people’s experiences.</p>

		<p>The play, the picture, and the poem and the
		novel and the symphony have all been the outgrowth
		of Eve’s infinity. She could not contain
		herself. She either had more experience
		than she could express, or she had more to
		express than she could possibly put into experience.</p>

		<p>One of the worst things that we know about
		the Japanese is that they have no imperative
		mood in the language. To be able to say of a
		nation that it has been able to live for thousands
		of years without feeling the need of an
		imperative, is one of the most terrible and
		sweeping accusations that has ever been made
		against a people on the earth. Swearing may
		not be respectable, but it is a great deal more
		respectable than never wanting to. Either a
		man is dead in this world, or he is out looking
		for words on it. There is a great place left
		over in him, and as long as that place is left
		over, it is one of the practical purposes of
		books to make it of some use to him. Whether
		the place is a good one or a bad one, something
		must be done with it, and books must do it.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page236" title="236"> </a>If there were wordlessness for five hundred
		years, man would seek vast inarticulate words
		for himself. Cathedrals would rise from the
		ground undreamed as yet to say we worshipped.
		Music would be the daily necessity of the
		humblest life. Orchestras all around the world
		would be created,—would float language
		around the dumbness in it. Composers would
		become the greatest, the most practical men
		in all the nations. Viaducts would stretch
		their mountains of stone across the valleys to
		find a word that said we were strong. Out of
		the stones of the hills, the mists of rivers, out
		of electricity, even out of silence itself, we
		would force expression. From the time a baby
		first moves his limbs to when—an old man—he
		struggles for his last breath, the one imperious
		divine necessity of life is expression. Hence
		the artist now and for ever—the ruler of history—whoever
		makes it. And if he cannot
		make it, he makes the makers of it. The
		artist is the man who, failing to find neighbours
		for himself, makes his neighbours with
		his own hands. If a woman is childless, she
		paints Madonnas. It is the inspiration, the
		despair that rests over all life. If we cannot
		express ourselves in things that are made, we
		make things, and if we cannot express ourselves
		in the things we make, we turn to
		words, and if we cannot express ourselves in
		words, we turn to other men’s words.</p>

		<p>The man who is satisfied with one life does
		<a class="pagenum" id="page237" title="237"> </a>not exist. The suicide does not commit suicide
		because he is tired of life, but because he wants
		so many more lives that he cannot have. The
		native of the tropics buys a book to the North
		Pole. If we are poor, we grow rich on paper.
		We roll in carriages through the highway of
		letters. If we are rich, we revel in a printed
		poverty. We cry our hearts out over our
		starving paper-children and hold our shivering,
		aching magazine hands over dying coals in
		garrets we live in by subscription at three dollars
		a year. The Bible is the book that has
		influenced men most in the world because it
		has expressed them the most. The moment
		it ceases to be the most expressive book, it will
		cease to be the most practical and effective one
		in human life. There is more of us than we
		can live. The touch of the infinite through
		which our spirits wandered is still upon us.
		The world cries to the poet: “Give me a new
		word—a word—a word! I will have a word!”
		It cries to the great man out of all its narrow
		places: “Give me another life! I will have a
		new life!” and every hero the world has
		known is worn threadbare with worship, because
		his life says for other men what their
		lives have tried to say. Every masterful life
		calls across the world a cry of liberty to pent-up
		dreams, to the ache of faith in all of us,
		“Here thou art my brother—this is thy heart
		that I have lived.” A hero is immortalised
		because his life is every man’s larger self. So
		<a class="pagenum" id="page238" title="238"> </a>through the day-span of our years—a tale that
		is never told—we wander on, the infinite heart
		of each of us prisoned in blood and flesh and
		the cry of us everywhere, throughout all being,
		“Give me room!” It cries to the composer,
		“Make a high wide place for me!” and
		on the edge of the silence between life and
		words, to music we come at last because it is
		the supreme confidante of the human heart,
		the confessional, the world-priest between the
		actual self and the larger self of all of us. With
		all the multiplying of arts and the piling up of
		books that have come to us, the most important
		experience that men have had in this world
		since they began on it, is that they are infinite,
		that they cannot be expressed on it. It is not
		infrequently said that men must get themselves
		expressed in living, but the fact remains that
		no one has ever heard of a man as yet who
		really did it, or who was small enough to do it.
		There was One who seemed to express Himself
		by living and by dying both, but if He had any
		more than succeeded in beginning to express
		Himself, no one would have believed that He
		was the Son of God,—even that He was the
		Son of Man. It was because He could not
		crowd all that He was into thirty-three short
		years and twelve disciples and one Garden of
		Gethsemane and one Cross that we know who
		He was.</p>

		<p>Riveted down to its little place with iron circumstance,
		the actual self in every man depends
		<a class="pagenum" id="page239" title="239"> </a>upon the larger possible self for the
		something that makes the actual self worth
		while. It is hard to be held down by circumstance,
		but it would be harder to be contented
		there, to live without those intimations of our
		diviner birth that come to us in books—books
		that weave some of the glory we have missed
		in our actual lives, into the glory of our
		thoughts. Even if life be to the uttermost the
		doing of what are called practical things, it is
		only by the occasional use of his imagination in
		reading or otherwise, that the practical man
		can hope to be in physical or mental condition
		to do them. He needs a rest from his actual
		self. A man cannot even be practical without
		this imaginary or larger self. Unless he can
		work off his unexpressed remnant, his limbs
		are not free. Even down to the meanest of
		us, we are incurably larger than anything we
		can do.</p>

		<p>Reading a book is a game a man plays with
		his own infinity.</p>

		Outward Bound</h4>

		<p>If there could only be arranged some mystical
		place over the edge of human existence, where
		we all could go and practise at living, have
		full-dress rehearsals of our parts, before we are
		hustled in front of the footlights in our very
		<a class="pagenum" id="page240" title="240"> </a>swaddling clothes, how many people are there
		who have reached what are fabulously called
		years of discretion, who would not believe in
		such a place, and who would not gladly go
		back to it and spend most of the rest of their
		lives there?</p>

		<p>This is one of the things that the world of
		books is for. Most of us would hardly know
		what to do without it, the world of books, if
		only as a place to make mistakes and to feel
		foolish in. It seems to be the one great unobserved
		retreat, where all the sons of men
		may go, may be seen flocking day and night,
		to get the experiences they would not have,
		to be ready for those they cannot help having.
		It is the Rehearsal Room of History.
		The gods watch it—this Place of Books—as we
		who live go silent, trooping back and forth in
		it—the ceaseless, heartless, awful, beautiful
		pantomime of life.</p>

		<p>It seems to be the testimony of human nature,
		after a somewhat immemorial experience,
		that some things in us had better be expressed
		by being lived, and that other things had better
		be expressed—if possible—in some other way.</p>

		<p>There are a great many men, even amongst
		the wisest and strongest of us, who benefit every
		year of their lives by what might be called the
		purgative function of literature,—men who, if
		they did not have a chance at the right moment
		to commit certain sins with their imaginary
		selves, would commit them with their real
		<a class="pagenum" id="page241" title="241"> </a>ones. Many a man of the larger and more
		comprehensive type, hungering for the heart
		of all experience, bound to have its spirit, if
		not itself, has run the whole gamut of his possible
		selves in books, until all the sins and all
		the songs of men have coursed through his
		being. He finds himself reading not only to
		fill his lungs with ozone and his heart with
		the strength of the gods, but to work off the
		humour in his blood, to express his underself,
		and get it out of the way. Women who never
		cry their tears out—it is said—are desperate,
		and men who never read their sins away are
		dangerous. People who are tired of doing
		wrong on paper do right. To be sick of one’s
		sins in a book saves not only one’s self but
		every one else a deal of trouble. A man has
		not learned how to read until he reads with
		his veins as well as his arteries.</p>

		<p>It would be useless to try to make out that
		evil passions in literature accomplish any absolute
		good, but they accomplish a relative
		good which the world can by no means afford
		to overlook. The amount of crime that is suggested
		by reading can be more than offset by
		the extraordinary amount of crime waiting in
		the hearts of men, aimed at the world and
		glanced off on paper.</p>

		<p>There are many indications that this purgative
		function of literature is the main thing it
		is for in our present modern life. Modern life
		is so constituted that the majority of people
		<a class="pagenum" id="page242" title="242"> </a>who live in it are expressing their real selves
		more truly in their reading than they are in
		their lives. When one stops to consider what
		these lives are—most of them—there can be
		but one conclusion about the reading of the
		people who have to live them, and that is that
		while sensational reading may be an evil, as
		compared with the evil that has made it necessary,
		it is an immeasurable blessing.</p>

		<p>The most important literary and artistic fact
		of the nineteenth century is the subdivision of
		labour—that is, the subdividing of every man’s
		life and telling him he must only be alive in a
		part of it. In proportion as an age takes sensations
		out of men’s lives it is obliged to put
		them into their literature. Men are used to
		sensations on the earth as long as they stay on
		it and they are bound to have them in one way
		or another. An age which narrows the actual
		lives of men, which so adjusts the labour of the
		world that nearly every man in it not only
		works with a machine, spiritual or otherwise,
		but is a machine himself, and a small part of a
		machine, must not find fault with its art for
		being full of hysterics and excitement, or with
		its newspapers for being sensational. Instead
		of finding fault it has every reason to be grateful—to
		thank a most merciful Heaven that the
		men in the world are still alive enough in it to
		be capable of feeling sensation in other men’s
		lives, though they have ceased to be capable
		of having sensations in their own, or of feeling
		<a class="pagenum" id="page243" title="243"> </a>sensations if they had them. It was when the
		herds of her people were buried in routine and
		peace that Rome had bull-fights. New York,
		with its hordes of drudges, ledger-slaves, machinists,
		and clerks, has the New York <cite>World</cite>.
		It lasts longer than a bull-fight and it can be
		had every morning before a man starts off to
		be a machine and every evening when he gets
		back from being a machine—for one cent. On
		Sunday a whole Colosseum fronts him and he is
		glutted with gore from morning until night.
		To a man who is a penholder by the week, or
		a linotype machine, or a ratchet in a factory, a
		fight is infinite peace. Obedience to the command
		of Scripture, making the Sabbath a day
		of rest, is entirely relative. Some of us are
		rested by taking our under-interested lives to
		a Sunday paper, and others are rested by taking
		our over-interested lives to church. Men
		read dime novels in proportion as their lives
		are staid and mechanical. Men whose lives
		are their own dime novels are bored by printed
		ones. Men whose years are crowded with
		crises, culminations, and events, who run the
		most risks in business, are found with the
		steadiest papers in their hands. The train-boy
		knows that the people who buy the biggest
		headlines are all on salaries and that danger
		and blood and thunder are being read nowadays
		by effeminately safe men, because it is the
		only way they can be had.</p>

		<p>But it is not only the things that are left out
		<a class="pagenum" id="page244" title="244"> </a>of men’s lives but the things they have too
		much of, which find their remedy in books.
		They are the levers with which the morbid is
		controlled. <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Similia similibus curantur</em> may be
		a dangerous principle to be applied by everybody,
		but thousands of men and women mulling
		away on their lives and worrying themselves
		with themselves, cutting a wide swath of misery
		wherever they go, have suddenly stopped in a
		book—have purged away jealousy and despair
		and passion and nervous prostration in it. A
		paper-person with melancholia is a better cure
		for gloom than a live clown can be—who
		merely goes about reminding people how sad
		they are.</p>

		<p>A man is often heard to say that he has
		tragedy enough in his own life not to want to
		go to a play for more, but this much having
		been said and truly said, he almost always goes
		to the play—to see how true it is. The stage
		is his huge confidante. Pitying one’s self is
		a luxury, but it takes a great while, and one
		can never do it enough. Being pitied by a
		five-thousand-dollar house, and with incidental
		music, all for a dollar and a half, is a sure and
		quick way to cheer up. Being pitied by Victor
		Hugo is a sure way also. Hardy can do people’s
		pitying for them much better than they
		can do it, and it’s soon over and done with.
		It is noticeable that while the impressive books,
		the books that are written to impress people,
		have a fair and nominal patronage, it is the
		<a class="pagenum" id="page245" title="245"> </a>expressive books, the books that let people
		out, which have the enormous sales. This
		seems to be true of the big-sale books whether
		the people expressed in them are worth expressing
		(to any one but themselves) or not.
		The principle of getting one’s self expressed is
		so largely in evidence that not only the best but
		the worst of our books illustrate it. Our popular
		books are carbuncles mostly. They are the
		inevitable and irrepressible form of the instinct
		of health in us, struggling with disease. On
		the whole, it makes being an optimist in
		modern life a little less of a tight-rope-walk.
		If even the bad elements in current literature—which
		are discouraging enough—are making
		us better, what shall be said of the good?</p>

			On Being Intelligent in a Library</h4>

			<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">I have</span> a way every two or three days or
			so, of an afternoon, of going down to our
			library, sliding into the little gate by the
			shelves, and taking a long empty walk there.
			I have found that nothing quite takes the place
			of it for me,—wandering up and down the aisles
			of my ignorance, letting myself be loomed at,
			staring doggedly back. I always feel when I
			go out the great door as if I had won a victory.
			I have at least faced the facts. I swing off to
			my tramp on the hills where is the sense of
			space, as if I had faced the bully of the world,
			the whole assembled world, in his own den,
			and he had given me a license to live.</p>

			<p>Of course it only lasts a little while. One
			soon feels a library nowadays pulling on him.
			<a class="pagenum" id="page250" title="250"> </a>One has to go back and do it all over again, but
			for the time being it affords infinite relief. It
			sets one in right relations to the universe, to
			the original plan of things. One suspects that
			if God had originally intended that men on this
			planet should be crowded off by books on it, it
			would not have been put off to the twentieth
			century.</p>

			<p>I was saying something of this sort to The
			Presiding Genius of the State of Massachusetts
			the other day, and when I was through he said
			promptly: “The way a man feels in a library
			(if any one can get him to tell it) lets out more
			about a man than anything else in the world.”</p>

			<p>It did not seem best to make a reply to this.
			I didn’t think it would do either of us any
			good.</p>

			<p>Finally, in spite of myself, I spoke up and
			allowed that I felt as intelligent in a library as

			<p>He did not say anything.</p>

			<p>When I asked him what he thought being
			intelligent in a library was, he took the general
			ground that it consisted in always knowing
			what one was about there, in knowing exactly
			what one wanted.</p>

			<p>I replied that I did not think that that was a
			very intelligent state of mind to be in, in a
			library.</p>

			<p>Then I waited while he told me (fifteen minutes)
			what an intelligent mind was anywhere
			(nearly everywhere, it seemed to me). But I
			<a class="pagenum" id="page251" title="251"> </a>did not wait in vain, and at last, when he had
			come around to it, and had asked me what I
			thought the feeling of intelligence consisted in,
			in libraries, I said it consisted in being pulled
			on by the books.</p>

			<p>I said quite a little after this, and of course
			the general run of my argument was that I was
			rather intelligent myself. The P. G. S. of M.
			had little to say to this, and after he had said
			how intelligent he was awhile, the conversation
			was dropped.</p>

			<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

			<p class="post_thoughtbreak">The question that concerns me is, What shall
			a man do, how shall he act, when he finds himself
			in the hush of a great library,—opens the
			door upon it, stands and waits in the midst of
			it, with his poor outstretched soul all by himself
			before <span class="small_all_caps">IT</span>,—and feels the books pulling on
			him? I always feel as if it were a sort of infinite
			crossroads. The last thing I want to
			know in a library is exactly what I want there.
			I am tired of knowing what I want. I am always
			knowing what I want. I can know what
			I want almost anywhere. If there is a place
			left on God’s earth where a modern man can
			go and go regularly and not know what he
			wants awhile, in Heaven’s name why not let
			him? I am as fond as the next man, I think,
			of knowing what I am about, but when I find
			myself ushered into a great library I do not
			know what I am about any sooner than I can
			help. I shall know soon enough—God forgive
			<a class="pagenum" id="page252" title="252"> </a>me! When it is given to a man to stand in the
			Assembly Room of Nations, to feel the ages,
			all the ages, gathering around him, flowing
			past his life; to listen to the immortal stir of
			Thought, to the doings of The Dead, why
			should a man interrupt—interrupt a whole
			world—to know what he is about? I stand at the
			junction of all Time and Space. I am the three
			tenses. I read the newspaper of the universe.</p>

			<p>It fades away after a little, I know. I go to
			the card catalogue like a lamb to the slaughter,
			poke my head into Knowledge—somewhere—and
			am lost, but the light of it on the spirit
			does not fade away. It leaves a glow there.
			It plays on the pages afterward.</p>

			<p>There is a certain fine excitement about taking
			a library in this fashion, a sense of spaciousness
			of joy in it, which one is almost always
			sure to miss in libraries—most libraries—by
			staying in them. The only way one can get
			any real good out of a modern library seems to
			be by going away in the nick of time. If one
			stays there is no help for it. One is soon standing
			before the card catalogue, sorting one’s wits
			out in it, filing them away, and the sense of
			boundlessness both in one’s self and everybody
			else—the thing a library is for—is fenced off
			for ever.</p>

			<p>At least it seems fenced off for ever. One sees
			the universe barred and patterned off with a
			kind of grating before it. It is a card-catalogue
			universe.</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page253" title="253"> </a>I can only speak for one, but I must say for
			myself, that as compared with this feeling one
			has in the door, this feeling of standing over a
			library—mere reading in it, sitting down and
			letting one’s self be tucked into a single book
			in it—is a humiliating experience.</p>

			How It Feels</h4>

			<p>I am not unaware that this will seem to some—this
			empty doting on infinity, this standing
			and staring at All-knowledge—a mere dizzying
			exercise, whirling one’s head round and round in
			Nothing, for Nothing. And I am not unaware
			that it would be unbecoming in me or in any
			other man to feel superior to a card catalogue.</p>

			<p>A card catalogue, of course, as a device for
			making a kind of tunnel for one’s mind in a
			library—for working one’s way through it—is
			useful and necessary to all of us. Certainly, if
			a man insists on having infinity in a convenient
			form—infinity in a box—it would be hard to
			find anything better to have it in than a card
			catalogue.</p>

			<p>But there are times when one does not want
			infinity in a box. He loses the best part of it
			that way. He prefers it in its natural state.
			All that I am contending for is, that when these
			times come, the times when a man likes to feel
			infinite knowledge crowding round him,—feel
			<a class="pagenum" id="page254" title="254"> </a>it through the backs of unopened books, and
			likes to stand still and think about it, worship
			with the thought of it,—he ought to be allowed
			to. It is true that there is no sign up against
			it (against thinking in libraries). But there
			might as well be. It amounts to the same
			thing. No one is expected to. People are expected
			to keep up an appearance, at least, of
			doing something else there. I do not dare to
			hope that the next time I am caught standing
			and staring in a library, with a kind of blank,
			happy look, I shall not be considered by all my
			kind intellectually disreputable for it. I admit
			that it does not look intelligent—this standing
			by a door and taking in a sweep of books—this
			reading a whole library at once. I can imagine
			how it looks. It looks like listening to a
			kind of cloth and paper chorus—foolish enough;
			but if I go out of the door to the hills again,
			refreshed for them and lifted up to them, with
			the strength of the ages in my limbs, great
			voices all around me, flocking my solitary walk—who
			shall gainsay me?</p>

			How a Specialist can Be an
			Educated Man</h4>

			<p>It is a sad thing to go into a library nowadays
			and watch the people there who are
			merely making tunnels through it. Some libraries
			<a class="pagenum" id="page255" title="255"> </a>are worse than others—seem to be made
			for tunnels. College libraries, perhaps, are the
			worst. One can almost—if one stands still
			enough in them—hear what is going on. It is
			getting to be practically impossible in a college
			library to slink off to a side shelf by one’s self,
			take down some gentle-hearted book one does
			not need to read there and begin to listen in it,
			without hearing some worthy person quietly,
			persistently boring himself around the next
			corner. It is getting worse every year. The
			only way a readable library book can be read
			nowadays is to take it away from the rest of
			them. It must be taken where no other reading
			is going on. The busy scene of a crowd of
			people—mere specialists and others—gathered
			around roofing their minds in is no fitting
			place for a great book or a live book to be read—a
			book that uncovers the universe.</p>

			<p>On the other hand, it were certainly a trying
			universe if it were uncovered all the time, if
			one had to be exposed to all of it and to all of
			it at once, always; and there is no denying that
			libraries were intended to roof men’s minds in
			sometimes as well as to take the roofs of their
			minds off. What seems to be necessary is to
			find some middle course in reading between the
			scientist’s habit of tunnelling under the dome
			of knowledge and the poet’s habit of soaring
			around in it. There ought to be some principle
			of economy in knowledge which will allow
			a man, if he wants to, or knows enough, to be a
			<a class="pagenum" id="page256" title="256"> </a>poet and a scientist both. It is well enough for
			a mere poet to take a library as a spectacle—a
			kind of perpetual Lick Observatory to peek at
			the universe with, if he likes, and if a man is a
			mere scientist, there is no objection to his taking
			a library as a kind of vast tunnel system,
			or chart for burrowing. But the common educated
			man—the man who is in the business of
			being a human being, unless he knows some
			middle course in a library, knows how to use
			its Lick Observatory and its tunnel system
			both—does not get very much out of it. If
			there can be found some principle of economy
			in knowledge, common to artists and scientists
			alike, which will make it possible for a poet to
			know something, and which will make it possible
			for a scientist to know a very great deal
			without being—to most people—a little underwitted,
			it would very much simplify the problem
			of being educated in modern times, and
			there would be a general gratefulness.</p>

			<p>Far be it from me to seem to wish to claim
			this general gratefulness for myself. I have no
			world-reforming feeling about the matter. I
			would be very grateful just here to be allowed
			to tuck in a little idea—no chart to go with it—on
			this general subject, which my mind
			keeps coming back to, as it runs around
			watching people.</p>

			<p>There seem to be but two ways of knowing.
			One of them is by the spirit and the other is by
			the letter. The most reasonable principle of
			<a class="pagenum" id="page257" title="257"> </a>economy in knowledge would seem to be, that
			in all reading that pertains to man’s specialty—his
			business in knowledge—he should read by
			the letter, knowing the facts by observing them
			himself, and that in all other reading he should
			read through the spirit of imagination—the
			power of taking to one’s self facts that have
			been observed by others. If a man wants
			to be a specialist he must do his knowing
			like a scientist; but if a scientist wants to be
			a man he must be a poet; he must learn how
			to read like a poet; he must educate in himself
			the power of absorbing immeasurable knowledge,
			the facts of which have been approved
			and observed by others.</p>

			<p>The weak point in our modern education
			seems to be that it has broken altogether with
			the spirit or the imagination. Playing upon
			the spirit or the imagination of a man is the
			one method possible to employ in educating
			him in everything except his specialty. It is
			the one method possible to employ in making
			even a powerful specialist of him; in relating
			his specialty to other specialties; that is, in
			making either him or his specialty worth while.</p>

			<p>Inasmuch as it has been decreed that every
			man in modern life must be a specialist, the
			fundamental problem that confronts modern
			education is, How can a specialist be an educated
			man? There would seem to be but one
			way a specialist can be an educated man. The
			only hope for a specialist lies in his being
			<a class="pagenum" id="page258" title="258"> </a>allowed to have a soul (or whatever he chooses
			to call it), a spirit or an imagination. If he
			has This, whatever it is, in one way or another,
			he will find his way to every book he needs.
			He will read all the books there are in his
			specialty. He will read all other books through
			their backs.</p>

			<h4 class="section_title"><abbr class="section_number" title="four">IV</abbr><br/>
			On Reading Books through Their
			Backs</h4>

			<p>As this is the only way the majority of books
			can be read by anybody, one wonders why so
			little has been said about it.</p>

			<p>Reading books through their backs is easily
			the most important part of a man’s outfit, if he
			wishes to be an educated man. It is not necessary
			to prove this statement. The books themselves
			prove it without even being opened.
			The mere outside of a library—almost any
			library—would seem to settle the point that if
			a man proposes to be in any larger or deeper
			sense a reader of books, the books must be read
			through their backs.</p>

			<p>Even the man who is obliged to open books
			in order to read them sooner or later admits
			this. He finds the few books he opens in the
			literal or unseeing way do not make him see
			anything. They merely make him see that he
			ought to have opened the others—that he must
			<a class="pagenum" id="page259" title="259"> </a>open the others; that is, if he is to know anything.
			The next thing he sees is that he must
			open all the others to know anything. When
			he comes to know this he may be said to have
			reached what is called, by stretch of courtesy,
			a state of mind. It is the scientific state of
			mind. Any man who has watched his mind a
			little knows what this means. It is the first
			incipient symptom in a mind that science is
			setting in.</p>

			<p>The only possible cure for it is reading books
			through their backs. As this scientific state of
			mind is the main obstacle nowadays in the way
			of reading books through their backs, it is fitting,
			perhaps, at this point that I should dwell
			on it a little.</p>

			<p>I do not claim to be a scientist, and I have
			never—even in my worst moments—hoped for
			a scientific mind. I am afraid I know as well
			as any one who has read as far as this, in this
			book, that I cannot prove anything. The book
			has at least proved that; but it does seem to me
			that there are certain things that very much
			need to be said about the scientific mind, in its
			general relation to knowledge. I would give
			the world to be somebody else for awhile and
			say them—right here in the middle of my book.
			But I know as well as any one, after all that
			has passed, that if I say anything about the
			scientific mind nobody will believe it. The best
			I can do is to say how I feel about the scientific
			mind. “And what has that to do with
			<a class="pagenum" id="page260" title="260"> </a>it?” exclaims the whole world and all its
			laboratories. What is really wanted in dealing
			with this matter seems to be some person—some
			grave, superficial person—who will take
			the scientific mind up scientifically, shake it
			and filter it, put it under the microscope, stare
			at it with a telescope, stick the X-ray through
			it, lay it on the operating table—show what is
			the matter with it—even to itself. Anything
			that is said about the scientific mind which is
			not said in a big, bow-wow, scientific, impersonal,
			out-of-the-universe sort of way will not
			go very far.</p>

			<p>And yet, the things that need to be said
			about the scientific mind—the things that need
			to be done for it—need to be said and done so
			very much, that it seems as if almost any one
			might help. So I am going to keep on trying.
			Let no one suppose, however, that because I
			have turned around the corner into another
			chapter, I am setting myself up as a sudden
			and new authority on the scientific mind. I do
			not tell how it feels to be scientific. I merely
			tell how it looks as if it felt.</p>

			<p>I have never known a great scientist, and I
			can only speak of the kind of scientist I have
			generally met—the kind every one meets nowadays,
			the average, bare scientist. He always
			looks to me as if he had a grudge against the
			universe—jealous of it or something. There
			are so many things in it he cannot know and
			that he has no use for unless he does. It
			<a class="pagenum" id="page261" title="261"> </a>always seems to me (perhaps it seems so to
			most of us in this world, who are running
			around and enjoying things and guessing on
			them) that the average scientist has a kind of
			dreary and disgruntled look, a look of feeling
			left out. Nearly all the universe goes to
			waste with a scientist. He fixes himself so
			that it has to. If a man cannot get the good of
			a thing until he knows it and knows all of it,
			he cannot expect to be happy in this universe.
			There are no conveniences for his being happy
			in it. It is the wrong size, to begin with.
			Exact knowledge at its best, or even at its
			worst, does not let a man into very many things
			in a universe like this one. A large part of it
			is left over with a scientist. It is the part that
			is left over which makes him unhappy.
			I am not claiming that a scientist, simply because
			he is a scientist, is any unhappier or
			needs to be any unhappier than other men are.
			He does not need to be. It all comes of a kind
			of brutal, sweeping, overriding prejudice he
			has against guessing on anything.</p>

			On Keeping Each Other in
			Countenance</h4>

			<p>I do not suppose that my philosophising on
			this subject—a sort of slow, peristaltic action
			of my own mind—is of any particular value;
			<a class="pagenum" id="page262" title="262"> </a>that it really makes any one feel any better except
			myself.</p>

			<p>But it has just occurred to me that I may
			have arisen, quite as well as not, without
			knowing it, to the dignity of the commonplace.</p>

			<p>“The man who thinks he is playing a solo in
			any human experience,” says this morning’s
			paper, “only needs a little more experience to
			know that he is a member of a chorus.” I
			suspect myself of being a Typical Case. The
			scientific mind has taken possession of all the
			land. It has assumed the right of eminent domain
			in it, and there must be other human beings
			here and there, I am sure, standing aghast
			at learning in our modern day, even as I am,
			their whys and wherefores working within
			them, trying to wonder their way out in this
			matter.</p>

			<p>All that is necessary, as I take it, is for one
			or the other of us to speak up in the world,
			barely peep in it, make himself known wherever
			he is, tell how he feels, and he will find
			he is not alone. Then we will get together.
			We will keep each other in countenance. We
			will play with our minds if we want to. We
			will take the liberty of knowing rows of things
			we don’t know all about, and we will be as
			happy as we like, and if we keep together we
			will manage to have a fairly educated look besides.
			I am very sure of this. But it is the
			sort of thing a man cannot do alone. If he
			tries to do it with any one else, any one that
			<a class="pagenum" id="page263" title="263"> </a>happens along, he is soon come up with. It
			cannot be done in that way. There is no one
			to whom to turn. Almost every mind one
			knows in this modern educated world is a suspicious,
			unhappy, abject, helpless, scientific
			mind.</p>

			<p>It is almost impossible to find a typical educated
			mind, either in this country or in Europe
			or anywhere, that is not a rolled-over mind,
			jealous and crushed by knowledge day and
			night, and yet staring at its ignorance everywhere.
			The scientist is almost always a man
			who takes his mind seriously, and he takes the
			universe as seriously as he takes his mind. Instead
			of glorying in a universe and being a little
			proud of it for being such an immeasurable,
			unspeakable, unknowable success, his whole
			state of being is one of worry about it. The
			universe seems to irritate him somehow. Has
			he not spent years of hard labour in making
			his mind over, in drilling it into not-thinking,
			into not-inferring things, into not-knowing
			anything he does not know all of? And yet
			here he is and here is his whole life—does it not
			consist in being baffled by germs and bacilli,
			crowed over by atoms, trampled on by the
			stars? It is getting so that there is but one
			thing left that the modern, educated scientific
			mind feels that it knows and that is the impossibility
			of knowledge. Certainly if there is anything
			in this wide world that can possibly be
			in a more helpless, more pulp-like state than
			<a class="pagenum" id="page264" title="264"> </a>the scientific mind in the presence of something
			that cannot be known, something that can
			only be used by being wondered at (which is
			all most of the universe is for), it has yet to be
			pointed out.</p>

			<p>He may be better off than he looks, and I
			don’t doubt he quite looks down on me as,</p>

			<div class="poem">
				<p>A mere poet,</p>
				<p>The Chanticleer of Things,</p>
				<p>Who lives to flap his wings—</p>
				<p>It’s all he knows,—</p>
				<p>They’re never furled;</p>
				<p>Who plants his feet</p>
				<p>On the ridge-pole of the world</p>
				<p>And crows.</p>
			</div>

			<p>Still, I like it very well. I don’t know anything
			better that can be done with the world,
			and as I have said before I say again, my
			friend and brother, the scientist, is either very
			great or very small, or he is moderately, decently
			unhappy. At least this is the way it
			looks from the ridge-pole of the world.</p>

			The Romance of Science</h4>

			<p>Science is generally accredited with being
			very matter-of-fact. But there has always been
			one romance in science from the first,—its romantic
			attitude toward itself. It would be hard
			to find any greater romance in modern times.
			<a class="pagenum" id="page265" title="265"> </a>The romance of science is the assumption that
			man is a plain, pure-blooded, non-inferring,
			mere-observing being and that in proportion as
			his brain is educated he must not use it. “Deductive
			reasoning has gone out with the nineteenth
			century,” says The Strident Voice.
			This is the one single inference that the scientific
			method seems to have been able to make—the
			inference that no inference has a right
			to exist.</p>

			<p>So far as I can see, if there are going to be
			inferences anyway, and one has to take one’s
			choice in inferring, I would rather have a few
			inferences on hand that I can live with every
			day than to have this one huge, voracious inference
			(the scientist’s) which swallows all the
			others up. For that matter, when the scientist
			has actually made it,—this one huge guess that
			he hasn’t a right to guess,—what good does it
			do him? He never lives up to it, and all the
			time he has his poor, miserable theory hanging
			about him, dogging him day and night. Does
			he not keep on guessing in spite of himself?
			Does he not live plumped up against mystery
			every hour of his life, crowded on by ignorance,
			forced to guess if only to eat? Is he not
			browbeaten into taking things for granted
			whichever way he turns? He becomes a doleful,
			sceptical, contradictory, anxious, disagreeable,
			disapproving person as a matter of course.</p>

			<p>One would think, in the abstract, that a certain
			serenity would go with exact knowledge;
			<a class="pagenum" id="page266" title="266"> </a>and it would, if a man were willing to put up
			with a reasonable amount of exact knowledge,
			eke it out with his brains, some of it; but when
			he wants all the exact knowledge there is, and
			nothing else but exact knowledge, and is not
			willing to mix his brains with it, it is different.
			When a man puts his whole being into a vise
			of exact knowledge, he finds that he has about
			as perfect a convenience for being miserable
			as could possibly be devised. He soon becomes
			incapable of noticing things or of enjoying
			things in the world for themselves. With one or
			two exceptions, I have never known a scientist
			to whom his knowing a thing, or not knowing
			it, did not seem the only important thing about it.
			Of course when a man’s mind gets into this
			dolefully cramped, exact condition, a universe
			like this is not what it ought to be for him. He
			lives too unprotected a life. His whole attitude
			toward the universe becomes one of wishing
			things would keep off of him in it—things he
			does not know. Are there not enough things
			he does not know even in his specialty? And
			as for this eternal being reminded of the others,
			this slovenly habit of “general information”
			that interesting people have—this guessing, inferring,
			and generalising—what is it all for?
			What does it all come to? If a man is after
			knowledge, let him have knowledge, knowledge
			that is knowledge, let him find a fact,
			anything for a fact, get God into a corner, hug
			one fact and live with it and die with it.</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page267" title="267"> </a>When a man once gets into this shut-in attitude
			it is of little use to put a word in, with
			him, for the daily habit of taking the roof off
			one’s mind, letting the universe play upon it
			instead of trying to bore a hole in it somewhere.
			“What does it avail after all, after it
			is all over, after a long life, even if the hole is
			bored,” I say to him, “to stand by one’s little
			hole and cry, ‘Behold, oh, human race, this
			Gimlet Hole which I have bored in infinite
			space! Let it be forever named for me.’”
			And in the meantime the poor fellow gets no
			joy out of living. He does not even get credit
			for his not-living, seventy years of it. He
			fences off his little place to know a little of nothing
			in, becomes a specialist, a foot note to
			infinite space, and is never noticed afterwards
			(and quite reasonably) by any one—not even
			by himself.</p>

			Monads</h4>

			<p>I am not saying that this is the way a scientist—a
			mere scientist, one who has the fixed
			habit of not reading books through their backs—really
			feels. It is the way he ought to feel.
			As often as not he feels quite comfortable. One
			sees one every little while (the mere scientist)
			dropping the entire universe with a dull thud
			and looking happy after it.</p>

			<p>But the best ones are different. Even those
			<a class="pagenum" id="page268" title="268"> </a>who are not quite the best are different. It is
			really a very rare scientist who joggles contentedly
			down without qualms, or without delays,
			to a hole in space. There is always a capability,
			an apparently left-over capability in him.
			What seems to happen is, that when the average
			human being makes up his mind to it, insists
			on being a scientist, the Lord keeps a
			remnant of happiness in him—a gnawing on
			the inside of him which will not let him rest.</p>

			<p>This remnant of happiness in him, his soul,
			or inferring organ, or whatever it may be,
			makes him suspect that the scientific method
			as a complete method is a false, superficial,
			and dangerous method, threatening the very
			existence of all knowledge that is worth knowing
			on the earth. He begins to suspect that
			a mere scientist, a man who cannot even make
			his mind work both ways, backwards or forwards,
			as he likes (the simplest, most rudimentary
			motion of a mind), inductively or
			deductively, is bound to have something left
			out of all of his knowledge. He sees that the
			all-or-nothing assumption in knowledge, to say
			nothing of not applying to the arts, in which it
			is always sterile, does not even apply to the
			physical sciences—to the mist, dust, fire, and
			water out of which the earth and the scientist
			are made.</p>

			<p>For men who are living their lives as we are
			living ours, in the shimmer of a globule in
			space, it is not enough that we should lift our
			<a class="pagenum" id="page269" title="269"> </a>faces to the sky and blunder and guess at a
			God there, because there is so much room between
			the stars, and murmur faintly, “Spiritual
			things are spiritually discerned.” By the infinite
			bones of our bodies, by the seeds of the
			million years that flow in our veins, <em>material</em>
			things are spiritually discerned. There is not
			science enough nor scientific method enough in
			the schools of all Christendom for a man to
			listen intelligently to his own breathing with,
			or to know his own thumb-nail. Is not his own
			heart thundering the infinite through him—beating
			the eternal against his sides—even
			while he speaks? And does he not know it
			while he speaks?</p>

			<p>By the time a man’s a Junior or a Senior
			nowadays, if he feels the eternal beating
			against his sides he thinks it must be something
			else. He thinks he ought to. It is a
			mere inference. At all events he has little
			use for it unless he knows just how eternal
			it is. I am speaking too strongly? I suppose
			I am. I am thinking of my four special
			boys—boys I have been doing my living in,
			the last few years. I cannot help speaking a
			little strongly. Two of them—two as fine,
			flash-minded, deep-lit, wide-hearted fellows as
			one would like to see, are down at <span class="keep_together">W——</span>, being
			cured of inferring in a four years’ course at
			the <span class="keep_together">W——</span> Scientific School. Another one,
			who always seemed to me to have real
			genius in him, who might have had a period in
			<a class="pagenum" id="page270" title="270"> </a>literature named after him, almost, if he’d
			stop studying literature, is taking a graduate
			course at <span class="keep_together">M——</span>, learning that it cannot be
			proved that Shakespeare wrote Shakespeare.
			He has already become one of these spotlessly
			accurate persons one expects nowadays.
			(I hardly dare to hope he will even read this
			book of mine, with all his affection for me,
			after the first few pages or so, lest he should
			fall into a low or wondering state of mind.)
			My fourth boy, who was the most promising
			of all, whose mind reached out the farthest,
			who was always touching new possibilities,
			a fresh, warm-blooded, bright-eyed fellow, is
			down under a manhole studying God in the
		    <span class="keep_together">N——</span> Theological Seminary.</p>

			<p>This may not be exactly a literal statement,
			nor a very scientific way to criticise the scientific
			method, but when one has had to sit
			and see four of the finest minds he ever knew
			snuffed out by it,—whatever else may be said
			for science, scientific language is not satisfying.
			What is going to happen to us next, in our
			little town, I hardly dare to know. I only
			know that three relentlessly inductive, dull,
			brittle, <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">blasé</em>, and springless youths from <span class="keep_together">S——</span>
			University have just come down and taken
			possession of our High School. They seem to
			be throwing, as near as I can judge, a spell
			of the impossibility of knowledge over the boys
			we have left.</p>

			<p>I admit that I am in an unreasonable state of
			<a class="pagenum" id="page271" title="271"> </a>mind.<a href="#footnote_3" id="fnm3" title="Fact." class="fnmarker">3</a> I think a great many people are. At
			least I hope so. There is no excuse for not being
			a little unreasonable. Sometimes it almost
			seems, when one looks at the condition of
			most college boys’ minds, as if our colleges
			were becoming the moral and spiritual and intellectual
			dead-centres of modern life.</p>

			<p>I will not yield to any man in admiration
			for Science—holy and speechless Science;
			holier than any religion has ever been yet;
			what religions are made of and are going to be
			made of, nor am I dating my mind three
			hundred years back and trying to pick a
			quarrel with Lord Bacon. I am merely wondering
			whether, if science is to be taught at
			all, it had not better be taught, in each branch
			of it, by men who are teaching a subject they
			have conceived with their minds instead of a
			subject which has been merely unloaded on
			them, piled up on top of their minds, and which
			their minds do not know anything about.</p>

			<p>No one seems to have stopped to notice what
			the spectacle of science as taught in college is
			getting to be—the spectacle of one set of
			minds which has been crunched by knowledge
			crunching another set. Have you never been
			to One, oh Gentle Reader, and watched It,
			watched It when It was working, one of these
			great Endowed Fact-machines, wound up by
			the dead, going round and round, thousands
			and thousands of youths in it being rolled out
			<a class="pagenum" id="page272" title="272"> </a>and chilled through and educated in it, having
			their souls smoothed out of them? Hundreds
			of human minds, small and sure and hard,
			working away on thousands of other human
			minds, making them small and sure and hard.
			Matter—infinite matter everywhere—taught
			by More Matter,—taught the way Matter
			would teach if it knew how—without generalising,
			without putting facts together to make
			truths out of them.</p>

			<p>It would seem, looking at it theoretically,
			that Science, of all things in this world, the stuff
			that dreams are made of; the one boundless
			subject of the earth, face to face and breath to
			breath with the Creator every minute of its life,
			would be taught with a divine touch in it, with
			the appeal to the imagination and the soul, to
			the world-building instinct in a man, the thing
			in him that puts universes together, the thing
			in him that fills the whole dome of space and all
			the crevices of being with the whisper of God.</p>

			<p>But it is not so. Science is great, and great
			scientists are great as a matter of course; but
			the sciences in the meantime are being taught
			in our colleges—in many of them, most of
			them—by men whose minds are mere registering
			machines. The facts are put in at one end
			(one click per fact) and come out facts at the
			other. The sciences are being taught more
			and more every year by moral and spiritual
			stutterers, men with non-inferring minds, men
			who live in a perfect deadlock of knowledge,
			<a class="pagenum" id="page273" title="273"> </a>men who cannot generalise about a fly’s wing,
			bashful, empty, limp, and hopeless and doddering
			before the commonplacest, sanest, and
			simplest generalisations of human life. In The
			Great Free Show, in our common human peep
			at it, who has not seen them, staggering to
			know what the very children, playing with
			dolls and rocking-horses, can take for granted?
			Minds which seem absolutely incapable of
			striking out, of taking a good, manly stride on
			anything, mincing in religion, effeminate in
			enthusiasm—please forgive me, Gentle Reader,
			I know I ought not to carry on in this fashion,
			but have I not spent years in my soul
			(sometimes it seems hundreds of years) in
			being humble—in being abject before this
			kind of mind? It is only a day almost since
			I have found it out, broken away from it, got
			hold of the sky to hoot at it with. I am free
			now. I am not going to be humble longer, before
			it. I have spent years dully wondering before
			this mind; wondering what was the matter
			with me that I could not love it, that I could
			not go where it loved to go, and come when
			it said “Come” to me. I have spent years in
			dust and ashes before it, struggling with myself,
			trying to make myself small enough to follow
			this kind of a mind around, and now the
			scales are fallen from my eyes. When I follow
			An Inductive Scientific Mind now, or try to
			follow it through its convolutions of matter-of-fact,
			its involutions of logic, its wriggling
			<a class="pagenum" id="page274" title="274"> </a>through axioms, I smile a new smile and my
			heart laughs within me. If I miss the point,
			I am not in a panic, and if, at the end of the
			seventeenth platitude that did not need to be
			proved, I find I do not know where I am, I
			thank God.</p>

			<p>I know that I am partly unreasonable, and
			I know that in my chosen station on the
			ridge-pole of the world it is useless to criticise
			those who do not even believe, probably, that
			worlds have ridge-poles. It is a bit hard to
			get their attention—and I hope the reader will
			overlook it if one seems to speak rather loud—from
			ridge-poles. Oh, ye children of The Literal!
			ye most serene Highnesses, ye archangels
			of Accuracy, the Voices of life all challenge
			you—the world around! What are ye, after
			all, but pilers-up of matter, truth-stutterers,
			truth-spellers, sunk in protoplasm to the tops
			of your souls? What is it that you are going
			to do with us? How many generations of
			youths do you want? When will souls be allowed
			again? When will they be allowed in
			college?</p>

			<p>Well, well, I say to my soul, what does it all
			come to? Why all this ado about it one way or
			the other? Is it not a great, fresh, eager,
			boundless world? Does it not roll up out of
			Darkness with new children on it, night after
			night? What does it matter, I say to my soul-a
			generation or so—from the ridge-pole of the
			world? The great Sun comes round again. It
			<a class="pagenum" id="page275" title="275"> </a>travels over the tops of seas and mountains.
			Microbes in their dewdrops, seeds in their
			winds, stars in their courses, worms in their
			apples, answer it, and the hordes of the ants
			in their ant-hills run before it. And what does
			it matter after all, under the great Dome, a
			few hordes of factmongers more or less, glimmering
			and wonderless, crawlers on the bottom
			of the sea of time, lovers of the ooze of knowledge,
			feeling with slow, myopic mouths at
			Infinite Truth?</p>

			<p>But when I see my four faces—the faces of
			my four special boys, when I hear the college
			bells ringing to them, it matters a great deal.
			My soul will not wait. What is the ridge-pole
			of the world? The distance of a ridge-pole
			does not count. The extent of a universe
			does not seem to make very much difference.
			The next ten generations do not help very
			much on this one. I go forth in my soul. I
			take hold of the first scientist I meet—my
			whole mind pummelling him. “What is it?”
			I say, “what is it you are doing with us and
			with the lives of our children? What is it
			you are doing with yourself? Truth is not a
			Thing. Did you think it? Truth is not even
			a Heap of Things. It is a Light. How dare
			you mock at inferring? How dare you to
			think to escape the infinite? You cannot
			escape the infinite even by making yourself
			small enough. It is written that thou shalt be
			infinitely small if thou art not infinitely large.
			<a class="pagenum" id="page276" title="276"> </a>Not to infer is to contradict the very nature of
			facts. Not to infer is not to live. It is to cease
			to be a fact one’s self. What is education if
			one does not infer? Vacuums rolling around
			in vacuums. Atoms cross-examining atoms.
			And you say you will not guess? Do you need
			to be cudgelled with a whole universe to begin
			to learn to guess? What is all your science—your
			boasted science, after all, but more raw
			material to make more guesses with? Is not
			the whole Future Tense an inference? Is not
			History—that which has actually happened—a
			mystery? You yourself are a mere probability,
			and God is a generalisation. What does it
			profit a man to discover The Inductive Method
			and to lose his own soul? What is The Inductive
			Method? Do you think that all these
			scientists who have locked their souls up and a
			large part of their bodies, in The Inductive
			Method, if they had waited to be born by The
			Inductive Method, would ever have heard of
			it? Being born is one inference and dying is
			another. Man leaves a wake of infinity after
			him wherever he goes, and of course it’s where
			he doesn’t go. It’s all infinity—one way or
			the other.”</p>

			<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

			<p class="post_thoughtbreak">And it came to pass in my dream as I lay on
			my bed in the night, I thought I saw Man my
			brother blinking under the dome of space, infinite
			monad that he is: I saw him with a glass
			in one hand and a Slide of Infinity in the other,
			<a class="pagenum" id="page277" title="277"> </a>and, in my dream, out of His high heaven God
			leaned down to me and said to me, “What is

			<p>And as I looked I laughed and prayed in my

			cried. “I do not know, but I think—<em>I think</em>—it

			<p>And a very pretty sight it is, too, oh Brother

			Multiplication Tables</h4>

			<p>It would seem to be the main trouble with
			the scientific mind of the second rank that it
			overlooks the nature of knowledge in the thirst
			for exact knowledge. In an infinite world the
			better part of the knowledge a man needs to
			have does not need to be exact.</p>

			<p>These things being as they are, it would seem
			that the art of reading books through their
			<a class="pagenum" id="page278" title="278"> </a>backs is an equally necessary art to a great
			scientist and to a great poet. If it is necessary
			to great scientists and to great poets it is all the
			more necessary to small ones, and to the rest of
			us. It is the only way, indeed, in which an immortal
			human being of any kind can get what
			he deserves to have to live his life with—a
			whole cross-section of the universe. A gentleman
			and a scholar will take nothing less.</p>

			<p>If a man is to get his cross-section of the universe,
			his natural share in it, he can only get it
			by living in the qualities of things instead of
			the quantities; by avoiding duplicate facts,
			duplicate persons, and principles; by using the
			multiplication table in knowledge (inference)
			instead of adding everything up, by taking all
			things in this world (except his specialty)
			through their spirits and essences, and, in general,
			by reading books through their backs.</p>

			<p>The problem of cultivating these powers in
			a man, when reduced to its simplest terms, is
			reduced to the problem of cultivating his imagination
			or organ of not needing to be told
			things.</p>

			<p>However much a man may know about wise
			reading and about the principles of economy in
			knowledge, in an infinite world the measure of
			his knowledge is bound to be determined, in
			the long run, by the capacity of his organ of
			not needing to be told things—of reading
			books through their backs.</p>

			On Changing One’s Conscience</h4>

			<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">We</span> were sitting by my fireplace—several
			of our club. I had just been reading
			out loud a little thing of my own. I have forgotten
			the title. It was something about Books
			that Other People ought to Read, I think.
			I stopped rather suddenly, rather more suddenly
			than anybody had hoped. At least nobody
			had thought what he ought to say about
			it. And I saw that the company, after a sort
			of general, vague air of having exclaimed properly,
			was settling back into the usual helpless
			silence one expects—after the appearance of an
			idea at clubs.</p>

			<p>“Why doesn’t somebody say something?”
			I said.</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page280" title="280"> </a>P. G. S. of M.: “We are thinking.”</p>

			<p>“Oh,” I said. I tried to feel grateful. But
			everybody kept waiting.</p>

			<p>I was a good deal embarrassed and was getting
			reckless and was about to make the very
			serious mistake, in a club, of seeing if I could
			not rescue one idea by going out after it with
			another, when The Mysterious Person (who is
			the only man in our club whose mind ever
			really comes over and plays in my yard) in the
			goodness of his heart spoke up. “I have not
			heard anything in a long time,” he began (the
			club looked at him rather anxiously), “which
			has done—which has made me feel—less
			ashamed of myself than this paper. <span class="keep_together">I——”</span></p>

			<p>It seemed to me that this was not exactly a
			fortunate remark. I said I didn’t doubt I
			could do a lot of good that way, probably, if I
			wanted to—going around the country making
			people less ashamed of themselves.</p>

			<p>“But I don’t mean that I feel really ashamed
			of myself about books I have not read,” said
			The Mysterious Person. “What I mean is,
			that I have a kind of slinking feeling that I
			ought to—a feeling of being ashamed for not
			being ashamed.”</p>

			<p>I told The M. P. that I thought New England
			was full of people; just like him—people
			with a lot of left-over consciences.</p>

			<p>The P. G. S. of M. wanted to know what I
			meant by that.</p>

			<p>I said I thought there were thousands of
			<a class="pagenum" id="page281" title="281"> </a>people—one sees them everywhere in Massachusetts—fairly
			intelligent people, people
			who are capable of changing their minds
			about things, but who can’t change their
			consciences. Their consciences seem to keep
			hanging on to them, in the same set way—somehow—with
			or without their minds.
			“Some people’s consciences don’t seem to notice
			much, so far as I can see, whether they
			have minds connected with them or not.”
			“Don’t you know what it is,” I appealed to
			the P. G. S. of M., “to get everything all fixed
			up with your mind and your reason and your
			soul; that certain things that look wrong are
			all right,—the very things of all others that you
			ought to do and keep on doing,—and then have
			your conscience keep right on the same as it
			always did—tatting them up against you?”</p>

			<p>The P. G. S. of M. said something about not
			spending very much time thinking about his
			conscience.</p>

			<p>I said I didn’t believe in it, but I thought
			that if a man had one, it was apt to trouble him
			a little off and on—especially if the one he had
			was one of these left-over ones. “If you had
			one of these consciences—I mean the kind of
			conscience that pretends to belong to you, and
			acts as if it belonged to some one else,” I said
			“one of these dead-frog-leg, reflex-action
			consciences, working and twitching away on
			you day and night, the way I have, you’d
			<em>have</em> to think about it sometimes. You’d get
			<a class="pagenum" id="page282" title="282"> </a>so ashamed of it. You’d feel trifled with so.
			<span class="keep_together">You’d——”</span></p>

			<p>The P. G. S. of M. said something about not
			being very much surprised—over my case. He
			said that people who changed their minds as
			often as I did couldn’t reasonably expect consciences
			spry enough.</p>

			<p>His general theory seemed to be that I had
			a conscience once and wore it out.</p>

			<p>“It’s getting to be so with everybody nowadays,”
			he said. “Nobody is settled. Everything
			is blown about. We do not respect
			tradition either in ourselves or in the life about
			us. No one listens to the Voice of Experience.”</p>

			<p>“There she blows!” I said. I knew it was
			coming sooner or later. I added that one of
			the great inconveniences of life, it seemed to
			me, was the Intolerance of Experienced People.</p>

		<div id="section_3.2.2" class="section">
			<h4 class="section_title"><abbr class="section_number" title="two">II</abbr><br/>
			On the Intolerance of Experienced
			People</h4>


			<p>It is generally assumed by persons who have
			taken the pains to put themselves in this very
			disagreeable class, that people in general—all
			other people—are as inexperienced—as they
			look. If a man speaks on a subject at all in
			their presence, they assume he speaks autobiographically.
			These people are getting thicker
			<a class="pagenum" id="page283" title="283"> </a>every year. One can’t go anywhere without
			finding them standing around with a kind of
			“How-do-you-know?” and “Did-it-happen-to-you?”
			air every time a man says something
			he knows by—well—by seeing it—perfectly
			plain seeing it. One doesn’t need to stand up
			to one’s neck in experience, in a perfect muck
			of experience, in order to know things, in order
			to know they are there. People who are experienced
			within an inch of their lives, submerged
			in experience, until all you can see of them is
			a tired look, are always calling out to the man
			who sees a thing as he is going by—sees it, I
			mean, with his mind; sees it without having
			to put his feet in it—they are always calling
			out to him to come back and be with them, and
			know life, as they call it, and duck under to
			Experience. Now, to say nothing of living
			with such persons, it is almost impossible to
			talk with them. It isn’t safe even to philosophise
			when they are around. If a man ventures
			the assertion in their presence that what
			a woman loves in a lover is complete subjugation
			they argue that either he is a fool and is
			asserting what he has not experienced, or he is
			still more of one and has experienced it. The
			idea that a man may have several principles
			around him that he has not used yet does not
			occur to them. The average amateur mother,
			when she belongs to this type, becomes a perfect
			bigot toward a maiden aunt who advances,
			perhaps, some harmless little Froebel idea. She
			<a class="pagenum" id="page284" title="284"> </a>swears by the shibboleth of experience, and
			every new baby she has makes her more disagreeable
			to people who have not had babies.
			The only way to get acquainted with her is to
			have a baby. She assumes that a motherless
			woman has a motherless mind. The idea that
			a rich and bountiful womanhood, which is saving
			its motherhood up, which is free from the
			absorption and the haste, keenly observant and
			sympathetic, may come to a kind of motherly
			insight, distinctly the result of not being experienced,
			does not occur to her. The art of
			getting the result—the spirit of experience,
			without paying all the cost of the experience
			itself—needs a good word spoken for it nowadays.
			Some one has yet to point out the value
			and power of what might be called The Maiden-Aunt
			Attitude toward Life. The world has
			had thousands of experienced young mothers
			for thousands of years—experienced out of
			their wits—piled up with experiences they
			don’t know anything about; but, in the meantime,
			the most important contribution to the
			bringing-up of children in the world that has
			ever been known—the kindergarten—was
			thought of in the first place by a man who was
			never a mother, and has been developed entirely
			in the years that have followed since by
			maiden aunts.</p>

			<p>The spiritual power and manifoldness and
			largeness which is the most informing quality
			of a really cultivated man comes from a certain
			<a class="pagenum" id="page285" title="285"> </a>refinement in him, a gift of knowing by tasting.
			He seems to have touched the spirits of
			a thousand experiences we know he never has
			had, and they seem to have left the souls of
			sorrows and joys in him. He lives in a kind
			of beautiful magnetic fellowship with all real
			life in the world. This is only possible by a
			sort of unconscious economy in the man’s nature,
			a gift of not having to experience things.</p>

			<p>Avoiding experience is one of the great creative
			arts of life. We shall have enough before
			we die. It is forced upon us. We cannot even
			select it, most of it. But, in so far as we can
			select it,—in one’s reading, for instance,—it
			behooves a man to avoid experience. He at
			least wants to avoid experience enough to have
			time to stop and think about the experience he
			has; to be sure he is getting as much out of his
			experience as it is worth.</p>

			<h4 class="section_title"><abbr class="section_number" title="three">III</abbr><br/>
				On Having One’s Experience Done
				Out</h4>

			<p>“But how can one avoid an experience?”</p>

			<p>By heading it off with a principle. Principles
			are a lot of other people’s experiences, in
			a convenient form a man can carry around with
			him, to keep off his own experiences with.</p>

			<p>No other rule for economising knowledge
			can quite take the place, it seems to me, of
			<a class="pagenum" id="page286" title="286"> </a>reading for principles. It economises for a
			man both ways at once. It not only makes it
			possible for a man to have the whole human
			race working out his life for him, instead of
			having to do it all himself, but it makes it possible
			for him to read anything he likes, to get
			something out of almost anything he does not
			like, which he is obliged to read. If a man has
			a habit of reading for principles, for the law
			behind everything, he cannot miss it. He
			cannot help learning things, even from people
			who don’t know them.</p>

			<p>The other evening when The P. G. S. of M.
			came into my study, he saw the morning paper
			lying unopened on the settle by the fireplace.</p>

			<p>“Haven’t you read this yet?” he said.</p>

			<p>“No, not to-day.”</p>

			<p>“Where are you, anyway? Why not?”</p>

			<p>I said I hadn’t felt up to it yet, didn’t feel
			profound enough—something to that effect.</p>

			<p>The P. G. S. of M. thinks a newspaper
			should be read in ten minutes. He looked over
			at me with a sort of slow, pitying, Boston-Public-Library
			expression he has sometimes.</p>

			<p>I behaved as well as I could—took no notice
			for a minute.</p>

			<p>“The fact is, I have changed,” I said,
			“about papers and some things. I have times
			of thinking I’m improved considerably,” I
			added recklessly.</p>

			<p>Still the same pained Boston-Public-Library
			expression—only turned on a little harder.</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page287" title="287"> </a>“Seems to me,” I said, “when a man can’t
			feel superior to other people in this world, he
			might at least be allowed the privilege of feeling
			superior to himself once in a while—spells
			of it.”</p>

			<p>He intimated that the trouble with me was
			that I wanted both. I admitted that I had
			cravings for both. I said I thought I’d be a
			little easier to get along with, if they were
			more satisfied.</p>

			<p>He intimated that I was easier to get along
			with than I ought to be, or than I seemed to
			think I was. He did not put it in so many
			words. The P. G. S. of M. never says anything
			that can be got hold of and answered.
			Finally I determined to answer him whether
			he had said anything or not.</p>

			<p>“Well,” I said, “I may feel superior to
			other people sometimes. I may even feel superior
			to myself, but I haven’t got to the
			point where I feel superior to a newspaper—to
			a whole world at once. I don’t try to read it in
			ten minutes. I don’t try to make a whole day
			of a whole world, a foot-note to my oatmeal
			mush! I don’t treat the whole human race,
			trooping past my breakfast, as a parenthesis in
			my own mind. I don’t try to read a great,
			serious, boundless thing like a daily newspaper,
			unfolded out of starlight, gleaner of a
			thousand sunsets around a world, and talk at
			the same time. I don’t say, ‘There’s nothing
			in it,’ interrupt a planet to chew my food,
			<a class="pagenum" id="page288" title="288"> </a>throw a planet on the floor and look for my
			hat…. Nations lunging through space
			to say good-morning to me, continents flashed
			around my thoughts, seas for the boundaries of
			my day’s delight … the great God shining
			over all! And may He preserve me from
			ever reading a newspaper in ten minutes!”</p>

			<p>I have spent as much time as any one, I
			think, in my day, first and last, in feeling superior
			to newspapers. I can remember when
			I used to enjoy it very much—the feeling, I
			mean. I have spent whole half-days at it,
			going up and down columns, thinking they
			were not good enough for me.</p>

			<p>Now when I take up a morning paper, half-dread,
			half-delight, I take it up softly. My
			whole being trembles in the balance before it.
			The whole procession of my soul, shabby, loveless,
			provincial, tawdry, is passed in review
			before it. It is the grandstand of the world.
			The vast and awful Roll-Call of the things I
			ought to be—the things I ought to love—in the
			great world voice sweeps over me. It reaches
			its way through all my thoughts, through the
			minutes of my days. “Where is thy soul?
			Oh, where is thy soul?” the morning paper,
			up and down its columns, calls to me. There
			are days that I ache with the echo of it.
			There are days when I dare not read it until
			the night. Then the voice that is in it grows
			gentle with the darkness, it may be, and is
			stilled with sleep.</p>

				On Reading a Newspaper in
				Ten Minutes</h4>

			<p>I am not saying it does not take a very intelligent
			man to read a newspaper in ten minutes—squeeze
			a planet at breakfast and drop it. I
			think it does. But I am inclined to think that
			the intelligent man who reads a newspaper in
			ten minutes is exactly the same kind of intelligent
			man who could spend a week reading it
			if he wanted to, and not waste a minute. And
			he might want to. He simply reads a newspaper
			as he likes. He is not confined to one
			way. He does not read it in ten minutes because
			he has a mere ten-minute mind, but because
			he merely has the ten minutes. Rapid
			reading and slow reading are both based, with
			such a man, on appreciation of the paper—and
			not upon a narrow, literary, Boston-Public-Library
			feeling of being superior to it.</p>

			<p>The value of reading-matter, like other matter,
			depends on what a man does with it. All
			that one needs in order not to waste time in
			general reading is a large, complete set of principles
			to stow things away in. Nothing really
			needs to be wasted. If one knows where everything
			belongs in one’s mind—or tries to,—if
			one takes the trouble to put it there, reading a
			newspaper is one of the most colossal, tremendous,
			and boundless acts that can be performed
			<a class="pagenum" id="page290" title="290"> </a>by any one in the whole course of a human
			life.</p>

			<p>If there’s any place where a man needs to
			have all his wits about him, to put things into,—if
			there’s any place where the next three
			inches can demand as much of a man as a newspaper,
			where is it? The moment he opens it
			he lays his soul open and exposes himself to
			all sides of the world in a second,—to several
			thousand years of a world at once.</p>

			<p>A book is a comparatively safe, unintelligent
			place for a mind to be in. There are at least
			four walls to it—a few scantlings over one, protecting
			one from all space. A man has at least
			some remotest idea of where he is, of what may
			drop on him, in a book. It may tax his capacity
			of stowing things away. But he always
			has notice—almost always. It sees that he has
			time and room. It has more conveniences for
			fixing things. The author is always there
			besides, a kind of valet to anybody, to help
			people along pleasantly, to anticipate their
			wants. It’s what an author is for. One expects
			it.</p>

			<p>But a man finds it is different in a morning
			paper, rolled out of dreams and sleep into it,—empty,
			helpless before a day, all the telegraph
			machines of the world thumping all the night,
			clicked into one’s thoughts before one thinks—no
			man really has room in him to read a
			morning paper. No man’s soul is athletic or
			swift enough…. Nations in a sentence.
			<a class="pagenum" id="page291" title="291"> </a>… Thousands of years in a minute, philosophies,
			religions, legislatures, paleozoics,
			church socials, side by side; stars and gossip,
			fools, heroes, comets—infinity on parade, and
			over the precipice of the next paragraph, head-long—who
			knows what!</p>

			<p>Reading a morning paper is one of the supreme
			acts of presence of mind in a human life.</p>

			General Information</h4>

			<p>“But what is going to become of us?” some
			one says, “if a man has to go through ‘the
			supreme act of presence of mind in a whole
			human life,’ every morning—and every morning
			before he goes to business? It takes as
			much presence of mind as most men have,
			mornings, barely to get up.”</p>

			<p>Well, of course, I admit, if a man’s going
			to read a newspaper to toe the line of all his
			convictions; if he insists on taking the newspaper
			as a kind of this-morning’s junction of
			all knowledge, he will have to expect to be a
			rather anxious person. One could hardly get
			one paper really read through in this way in
			one’s whole life. If a man is always going
			to read the news of the globe in such a serious,
			sensitive, suggestive, improving, Atlas-like
			fashion, it would be better he had never
			learned to read at all. At all events, if it’s
			<a class="pagenum" id="page292" title="292"> </a>a plain question between a man’s devouring
			his paper or letting his paper devour him, of
			course the only way to do is to begin the day
			by reading something else, or by reading it in
			ten minutes and forgetting it in ten more. One
			would certainly rather be headlong—a mere
			heedless, superficial globe-trotter with one’s
			mind, than not to have any mind—to be wiped
			out at one’s breakfast table, to be soaked up
			into infinity every morning, to be drawn off,
			evaporated into all knowledge, to begin one’s
			day scattered around the edges of all the world.
			One would do almost anything to avoid this.
			And it is what always happens if one reads for
			principles pell-mell.</p>

			<p>All that I am claiming for reading for principles
			is, that if one reads for principles, one
			really cannot miss it in reading. There is always
			something there, and a man who treats a
			newspaper as if it were not good enough for
			him falls short of himself.</p>

			<p>The same is true of desultory reading so-called,
			of the habit of general information, and
			of the habit of going about noticing things—noticing
			things over one’s shoulder.</p>

			<p>I am inclined to think that desultory reading
			is as good if not better for a man than any
			other reading he can do, if he organises it—has
			habitual principles and swift channels of
			thought to pour it into. I do not think it is at
			all unlikely from such peeps as we common
			mortals get into the minds of men of genius,
			<a class="pagenum" id="page293" title="293"> </a>that their desultory reading (in the fine strenuous
			sense) has been the making of them. The
			intensely suggestive habit of thought, the prehensile
			power in a mind, the power of grasping
			wide-apart facts and impressions, of putting
			them into prompt handfuls, where anything
			can be done with them that one likes, could
			not possibly be cultivated to better advantage
			than by the practice of masterful and regular
			desultory reading.</p>

			<p>Certainly the one compelling trait in a work
			of genius, whether in music, painting, or literature,
			the trait of untraceableness, the semi-miraculous
			look, the feeling things give us
			sometimes, in a great work of art, of being at
			once impossible together, and inevitable together,—has
			its most natural background in
			what would seem at first probably, to most
			minds, incidental or accidental habits of observation.</p>

			<p>One always knows a work of art of the second
			rank by the fact that one can place one’s
			hand on big blocks of material in it almost
			everywhere, material which has been taken
			bodily and moved over from certain places.
			And one always knows a work of art of the
			first rank by the fact that it is absolutely defiant
			and elusive. There is a sense of infinity—a
			gathered-from-everywhere sense in it—of
			things which belong and have always belonged
			side by side and exactly where they are put,
			but which no one had put there.</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page294" title="294"> </a>It would be hard to think of any intellectual
			or spiritual habit more likely to give a man a
			bi-sexual or at least a cross-fertilising mind,
			than the habit of masterful, wilful, elemental,
			desultory reading. The amount of desultory
			reading a mind can do, and do triumphantly,
			may be said to be perhaps the supreme test of
			the actual energy of the mind, of the vital heat
			in it, of its melting-down power, its power of
			melting everything through, and blending everything
			in, to the great central essence of life.</p>

			<p>No more adequate plan, or, as the architects
			call it, no better elevation for a man could possibly
			be found than a daily newspaper of the
			higher type. For scope, points of view, topics,
			directions of interest, catholicity, many-sidedness,
			world-wideness, for all the raw material
			a large and powerful man must needs be made
			out of, nothing could possibly excel a daily
			newspaper. Plenty of smaller artists have been
			made in the world and will be made again in
			it—hothouse or parlour artists—men whose
			work has very little floor-space in it, one- or
			two-story men, and there is no denying that
			they have their place, but there never has been
			yet, and there never will be, I venture to say,
			a noble or colossal artist or artist of the first
			rank who shall not have as many stories in
			him as a daily newspaper. The immortal is
			the universal in a man looming up. If the
			modern critic who is looking about in this world
			of ours for the great artist would look where
			<a class="pagenum" id="page295" title="295"> </a>the small ones are afraid to go, he would stand
			a fair chance of finding what he is looking for.
			If one were to look about for a general plan, a
			rough draft or sketch of the mind of an Immortal,
			he will find that mind spread out before
			him in the interests and passions, the giant
			sorrows and delights of his morning paper.</p>

			<p>I am not coming out in this chapter to defend
			morning papers. One might as well pop up in
			one’s place on this globe, wherever one is on it,
			and say a good word for sunrises. What immediately
			interests me in this connection is the
			point that if a man reads for principles in this
			world he will have time and take time to be
			interested in a great many things in it. The
			point seems to be that there is nothing too
			great or too small for a human brain to carry
			away with it, if it will have a place to put it.
			All one has to do, to get the good of a man, a
			newspaper, a book, or any other action, a paragraph,
			or even the blowing of a wind, is to
			lift it over to its principle, see it and delight in
			it as a part of the whole, of the eternal, and of
			the running gear of things. Reading for principles
			may make a man seem very slow at first—several
			years slower than other people—but
			as every principle he reads with makes it possible
			to avoid at least one experience, and, at
			the smallest calculation, a hundred books, he
			soon catches up. It would be hard to find a
			better device for reading books through their
			backs, for travelling with one’s mind, than the
			<a class="pagenum" id="page296" title="296"> </a>habit of reading for principles. A principle is
			a sort of universal car-coupling. One can be
			joined to any train of thought in all Christendom
			with it, and rolled in luxury around the
			world in the private car of one’s own mind.</p>

			<p>But it is not so much as a luxury as a convenience
			that reading for principles appeals to
			a vigorous mind. It is the short-cut to knowledge.
			The man who is once started in reading
			for principles is not long in distancing the
			rest of us, because all the reading that he does
			goes into growth,—is saved up in a few handy,
			prompt generalisations. His whole being becomes
			alert and supple. He has the under-hold
			in dealing with nature, grips hold the law
			of the thing and rules it. He is capable of far
			reaches where others go step by step. In
			every age of the world of thought he goes
			about giant-like, lifting worlds with a laugh,
			doing with the very playing of his mind work
			which crowds of other minds toiling on their
			crowds of facts could not accomplish. He is
			only able to do this by being a master of principles.
			He has made himself a man who can
			handle a principle, a sum-total of a thousand
			facts as easily as other men, men with bare
			scientific minds, can handle one of the facts.
			He thinks like a god—not a very difficult thing
			to do. Any man can do it after thirty or forty
			years, if he gives himself the chance, if he reads
			for principles, keeps his imagination—the way
			Emerson did, for instance—sound and alive
			<a class="pagenum" id="page297" title="297"> </a>all through. He does not need to deny that
			the bare scientific method, the hugging of the
			outside of a thing, the being deliberately superficial
			and literal—the needing to know all of
			the facts, is a useful and necessary method at
			times; but outside of his specialty he takes the
			ground that the scientific method is not the
			normal method through which a man acquires
			his knowledge, but a secondary and useful
			method for verifying the knowledge he has.
			He acquires knowledge through the constant
			exercise of his mind with principles. He is full
			of subtle experiences he never had. He appears
			to other minds, perhaps, to go to the truth
			with a flash, but he probably does not. He
			does not have to go to the truth. He has the
			truth on the premises right where he can get
			at it, in its most convenient, most compact and
			spiritual form. To write or think or act he has
			but to strike down through the impressions,
			the experiences,—the saved-up experiences,—of
			his life, and draw up their principles.</p>

			<p>A great deal has been said from time to time
			among the good of late about the passing of
			the sermon as a practical working force. A
			great deal has been said among the literary
			about the passing of the essay. Much has been
			said also about the passing of poetry and the
			passing of religion in our modern life. It
			would not be hard to prove that what has been
			called, under the pressure of the moment, the
			passing of religion and poetry, and of the
			<a class="pagenum" id="page298" title="298"> </a>sermon and the essay, could fairly be traced to
			the temporary failure of education, the disappearance
			in the modern mind of the power of
			reading for principles. The very farm-hands
			of New England were readers for principles
			once—men who looked back of things—philosophers.
			Philosophers grew like the grass on
			a thousand hills. Everybody was a philosopher
			a generation ago. The temporary obscuration
			of religion and poetry and the sermon and the
			essay at the present time is largely due to the
			fact that generalisation has been trained out of
			our typical modern minds. We are mobbed
			with facts. We are observers of the letter of
			things rather than of the principles and spirits
			of things. The letter has been heaped upon us.
			Poetry and religion and the essay and the sermon
			are all alike, in that they are addressed to
			what can be taken for granted in men—to sum-totals
			of experience—the power of seeing sum-totals.
			They are addressed to generalising
			minds. The essayist of the highest rank induces
			conviction by playing upon the power of
			generalisation, by arousing the associations
			and experiences that have formed the principles
			of his reader’s mind. He makes his appeal
			to the philosophic imagination.</p>

			<p>It is true that a man may not be infallible in
			depending upon his imagination or principle-gathering
			organ for acquiring knowledge, and
			in the nature of things it is subject to correction
			and verification, but as a positive, practical,
			<a class="pagenum" id="page299" title="299"> </a>economical working organ in a world as large
			as this, an imagination answers the purpose as
			well as anything. To a finite man who finds
			himself in an infinite world it is the one possible
			practicable outfit for living in it.</p>

			<p>Reading for principles is its most natural
			gymnasium.</p>

			<span class="keep_together">But——</span></h4>

			<p>I had finished writing these chapters on the
			philosophic mind, and was just reading them
			over, thinking how true they were, and how
			valuable they were for me, and how I must act
			on them, when I heard a soft “Pooh!” from
			somewhere way down in the depths of my being.
			When I had stopped and thought, I saw
			it was my Soul trying to get my attention. “I
			do not want you always reading for principles,”
			said my Soul stoutly, “reading for a philosophic
			mind. I do not want a philosophic
			mind on the premises.”</p>

			<p>“Very well,” I said.</p>

			<p>“You do not want one yourself,” my Soul
			said, “you would be bored to death with one—with
			a mind that’s always reading for principles!”</p>

			<p>“I’m not so sure,” I said.</p>

			<p>“You always are with other people’s.”</p>

			<p>“Well, there’s Meakins,” I admitted.</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page300" title="300"> </a>“You wouldn’t want a Meakins kind of a
			mind, would you?” (Meakins is always reading
			for principles.)</p>

			<p>I refused to answer at once. I knew I didn’t
			want Meakins’s, but I wanted to know why.
			Then I fell to thinking. Hence this chapter.</p>

			<p>Meakins has changed, I said to myself. The
			trouble with him isn’t that he reads for principles,
			but he is getting so he cannot read for
			anything else. What a man really wants, it
			seems to me, is the use of a philosophic mind.
			He wants one where he can get at it, where he
			can have all the benefit of it without having to
			live with it. It’s quite another matter when a
			man gives his mind up, his own everyday mind—the
			one he lives with—lets it be coldly, deliberately
			philosophised through and through.
			It’s a kind of disease.</p>

			<p>When Meakins visits me now, the morning
			after he is gone I take a piece of paper and
			sum his visit up in a row of propositions.
			When he came before five years ago—his visit
			was summed up in a great desire in me, a lift,
			a vow to the universe. He had the same ideas,
			but they all glowed out into a man. They
			came to me as a man and for a man—a free,
			emancipated, emancipating, world-loving,
			world-making man—a man out in the open,
			making all the world his comrade. His appeal
			was personal.</p>

			<p>Visiting with him now is like sitting down
			with a stick or pointer over you and being compelled
			<a class="pagenum" id="page301" title="301"> </a>to study a map. He doesn’t care anything
			about me except as one more piece of
			paper to stamp his map on. And he doesn’t
			care anything about the world he has the map
			of, except that it is the world that goes with
			his map. When a man gets into the habit of
			always reading for principles back of things—back
			of real, live, particular things—he becomes
			inhuman. He forgets the things.
			Meakins bores people, because he is becoming
			inhuman. He treats human beings over and
			over again unconsciously, when he meets them,
			as mere generalisations on legs. His mind
			seems a great sea of abstractions—just a few
			real things floating palely around in it for illustrations.
			When I try to rebuke him for being
			a mere philosopher or man without hands, he
			is “setting his universe in order,” he says—making
			his surveys. He may be living in his
			philosophic mind now, breaking out his intellectual
			roads but he is going to travel on them
			later, he explains.</p>

			<p>In the meantime I notice one thing about
			the philosophic mind. It not only does not do
			things. It cannot even be talked with. It is
			not interested in things in particular. There
			is something garrulously, pedagogically unreal
			about it,—at least there is about Meakins’s.
			You cannot so much as mention a real or particular
			thing to Meakins but he brings out a
			row of fifteen or twenty principles that go
			with it, which his mind has peeked around and
			<a class="pagenum" id="page302" title="302"> </a>found behind it. By the time he has floated
			out about fifteen of them—of these principles
			back of a thing—you begin to wonder if the
			thing was there for the principles to be back of.
			You hope it wasn’t.</p>

			<p>As fond as I am of him, I cannot get at him
			nowadays in a conversation. He is always just
			around back of something. He is a ghost. I
			come home praying Heaven, every time I see
			him, not to let me evaporate. He talks about
			the future of humanity by the week, but I
			find he doesn’t notice humanity in particular.
			You cannot interest him in talking to
			him about himself, or even in letting him do
			his own talking about himself. He is a mere
			detail to himself. You are another detail.
			What you are and what he is are both mere
			footnotes to a philosophy. All history is a footnote
			to it—or at best a marginal illustration.
			There is no such thing as communing with
			Meakins unless you use (as I do) a torpedo or
			battering-ram as a starter. If you let him have
			his way he sits in his chair and in his deep,
			beautiful voice addresses a row of remarks to
			The Future in General—the only thing big
			enough or worth while to talk to. He sits
			perfectly motionless (except the whites of his
			eyes) and talks deeply and tenderly and instructively
			to the Next Few Hundred Years—to
			posterity, to babes not yet in their mothers’
			wombs, while his dearest friends sit by.</p>

			<p>If ever there was a man who could take a
			<a class="pagenum" id="page303" title="303"> </a>whole roomful of warm, vital people, sitting
			right next to him, pulsing and glowing in their
			joys and their sins, and with one single heroic
			motion of an imperious hand drop them softly
			and lovingly over into Fatuity and Oblivion in
			five minutes and leave them out of the world
			before their own eyes, it is Theophilus Meakins.
			I try sometimes—but I cannot really do
			it.</p>

			<p>He does not really commune with things or
			with persons at all. He gets what he wants
			out of them. You feel him putting people,
			when he meets them, through his philosophy.
			He makes them over while they wait, into extracts.
			A man may keep on afterward living
			and growing, throbbing and being, but he does
			not exist to Meakins except in his bottle. A
			man cannot help feeling with Meakins afterward
			the way milk feels probably, if it could
			only express it, when it’s been put through
			one of these separators, had the cream taken
			off of it. Half the world is skim-milk to him.
			But what does it matter to Meakins? He has
			them in his philosophy. He does the same
			way with things as with people. He puts in
			all nature as a parenthesis, and a rather condescending,
			explanatory one at that, a symbol, a
			kind of beckoning, an index-finger to God.
			He never notices a tree for itself. A great elm
			would have to call out to him, fairly shout at
			him, right under its arms: “Oh, Theophilus
			Meakins, author of <cite>The Habit of Eternity</cite>,
			<a class="pagenum" id="page304" title="304"> </a>author of <cite>The Evolution of the Ego</cite> look
			at ME, I also am alive, even as thou art.
			Canst thou not stop one moment and be glad
			with <em>me</em>? Have I not a thousand leaves glistening
			and glorying in the great sun? Have
			I not a million roots feeling for the stored-up
			light in the ground, reaching up God to me
			out of the dark? Have I not”—“It is one of
			the principles of the flux of society,” breaks in
			Theophilus Meakins, “as illustrated in all the
			processes of the natural world—the sap of this
			tree,” said he, “for instance,” brushing the elm-tree
			off into space, “that the future of mankind
			depends and always must depend <span class="keep_together">upon——”</span></p>

			<p>“The flux of society be <span class="keep_together">——,”</span> said I in holy
			wrath. I stopped him suddenly, the elm-tree
			still holding its great arms above us. “Do
			you suppose that God,” I said, “is in any such
			small business as to make an elm-tree like this—like
			THIS (look at it, man!), and put it on
			the earth, have it waving around on it, just to
			illustrate one of your sermons? Now, my dear
			fellow, I’m not going to have you lounging
			around in your mind with an elm-tree like this
			any longer. I want you to come right over to
			it,” said I, taking hold of him, “and sit down
			on one of its roots, and lean up against its
			trunk and learn something, live with it a minute—get
			blessed by it. The flux of society can
			wait,” I said.</p>

			<p>Meakins is always tractable enough, when
			shouted at, or pounded on a little. We sat
			<a class="pagenum" id="page305" title="305"> </a>down under the tree for quite a while, perfectly
			still. I can’t say what it did for Meakins. But
			it helped me—just barely leaning against the
			trunk of it helped me, under the circumstances,
			a great deal.</p>

			<p>No one will believe it, I suppose, but we
			hadn’t gotten any more than fifteen feet away
			from the shadow of that tree when “The
			principles of the flux of society,” said he,

			<p>“Now, my dear fellow,” I said, “there are
			a lot more elm-trees we really ought to take in,
			on this walk. <span class="keep_together">We——”</span></p>

			<p>“I SAY!” said Meakins, his great voice
			roaring on my little polite, opposing sentence
			like surf over a pebble, “that the <span class="keep_together">principles——”</span></p>

			<p>Then I grew wroth. I always do when
			Meakins treats what I say just as a pebble to
			get more roar out of, on the great bleak shore
			of his thoughts. “No one says anything!” I
			cried; “if any one says anything—if you say
			another word, my dear fellow, on this walk, I
			will sing <cite>Old Hundred</cite> as loud as I can all the
			way home.”</p>

			<p>He promised to be good—after a half-mile or
			so. I caught him looking at me, harking back
			to an old, wonderfully sweet, gentle, human,
			understanding smile he has—or used to have
			before he was a philosopher.</p>

			<p>Then he quietly mentioned a real thing and
			we talked about real things for four miles.</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page306" title="306"> </a>I remember we sat under the stars that night

			lit our hearts at them. Then we silently, happily,
			at last, both of us, like awkward, wondering
			boys, went to bed.</p>

			Inside</h4>

			<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">It</span> is always the same way. I no sooner get
			a good, pleasant, interesting, working idea,
			like this “Reading for Principles,” arranged
			and moved over, and set up in my mind, than
			some insinuating, persistent, concrete human
			being comes along, works his way in to illustrate
			it, and spoils it. Here is Meakins, for
			instance. I have been thinking on the other
			side of my thought every time I have thought
			of him. I have no more sympathy than any
			one with a man who spends all his time going
			round and round in his reading and everything
			else, swallowing a world up in principles.
			“Why should a good, live, sensible man,” I
			<a class="pagenum" id="page308" title="308"> </a>feel like saying, “go about in a world like this
			stowing his truths into principles, where, half
			the time, he cannot get at them himself, and
			no one else would want to?” Going about
			swallowing one’s experience up in principles is
			very well so far as it goes. But it is far better
			to go about swallowing up one’s principles into
			one’s self.</p>

			<p>A man who has lived and read into himself
			for many years does not need to read very
			many books. He has the gist of nine out of
			ten new books that are published. He knows,
			or as good as knows, what is in them, by taking
			a long, slow look at his own heart. So
			does everybody else.</p>

			On Being Lonely with a Book</h4>

			<p>The P. G. S. of M. said that as far as he
			could make out, judging from the way I talked,
			my main ambition in the world seemed to be to
			write a book that would throw all publishers
			and libraries out of employment. “And what
			will your book amount to, when you get it
			done?” he said. “If it’s convincing—the
			way it ought to be—it will merely convince
			people they oughtn’t to have read it.”</p>

			<p>“And that’s been done before,” I said.
			“Almost any book could do it.” I ventured
			to add that I thought people grew intelligent
			<a class="pagenum" id="page309" title="309"> </a>enough in one of my books—even in the first
			two or three chapters, not to read the rest of it.
			I said all I hoped to accomplish was to get people
			to treat other men’s books in the same way
			that they treated mine—treat everything that
			way—take things for granted, get the spirit of
			a thing, then go out and gloat on it, do something
			with it, live with it—anything but this
			going on page after page using the spirit of a
			thing all up, reading with it.</p>

			<p>“Reading down through in a book seems a
			great deal more important to me than merely
			reading the book through.”</p>

			<p>I expected that The P. G. S. of M. would ask
			me what I meant by reading down through,
			but he didn’t. He was still at large, worrying
			about the world. “I have no patience
			with it—your idea,” he broke out. “It’s all
			in the air. It’s impractical enough, anyway,
			just as an idea, and it’s all the more impractical
			when it’s carried out. So far as I can see,
			at the rate you’re carrying on,” said The P. G.
			S. of M., “what with improving the world and
			all with your book, there isn’t going to be
			anything but You and your Book left.”</p>

			<p>“Might be worse,” I said. “What one
			wants in a book after the first three or four
			chapters, or in a world either, it seems to me,
			is not its facts merely, nor its principles, but
			one’s self—one’s real relation of one’s real
			self, I mean, to some real fact. If worst came
			to worst and I had to be left all alone, I’d
			<a class="pagenum" id="page310" title="310"> </a>rather be alone with myself, I think, than with
			anybody. It’s a deal better than being lonely
			the way we all are nowadays—with such a lot
			of other people crowding round, that one has
			to be lonely with, and books and newspapers
			and things besides. One has to be lonely so
			much in civilisation, there are so many things
			and persons that insist on one’s coming over
			and being lonely with them, that being lonely
			in a perfectly plain way, all by one’s self—the
			very thought of it seems to me, comparatively
			speaking, a relief. It’s not what it ought to
			be, but it’s something.”</p>

			<p>I feel the same way about being lonely with
			a book. I find that the only way to keep from
			being lonely in a book—that is, to keep from
			being crowded on to the outside of it, after the
			first three or four chapters—is to read the first
			three or four chapters all over again—read
			them down through. I have to get hold of my
			principles in them, and then I have to work
			over my personal relation to them. When I
			make sure of that, when I make sure of my
			personal relation to the author, and to his
			ideas, and there is a fairly acquainted feeling
			with both of us, then I can go on reading for
			all I am worth—or all he is worth anyway,
			whichever breaks down first—and no more said
			about it. Everything means something to
			everybody when one reads down through. The
			only way an author and reader can keep from
			wasting each other’s time, it seems to me, at
			<a class="pagenum" id="page311" title="311"> </a>least from having spells of wasting it, is to
			begin by reading down through.</p>

			Keeping Other Minds Off</h4>

			<p>What I really mean by reading down through
			in a book, I suppose, is reading down through
			in it to myself. I dare say this does not seem
			worthy. It is quite possible, too, that there is
			no real defence for it—I mean for my being so
			much interested in myself in the middle of
			other people’s books. My theory about it is
			that the most important thing in this world for
			a man’s life is his being original in it. Being
			original consists, I take it, not in being different,
			but in being honest—really having something
			in one’s own inner experience which one
			has anyway, and which one knows one has,
			and which one has all for one’s own, whether
			any one else has ever had it or not. Being
			original consists in making over everything
			one sees and reads, into one’s self.</p>

			<p>Making over what one reads into one’s self
			may be said to be the only way to have a really
			safe place for knowledge. If a man takes his
			knowledge and works it all over into what he
			is, sense and spirit, it may cost more at first,
			but it is more economical in the long run, because
			none of it can possibly be lost. And it
			can all be used on the place.</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page312" title="312"> </a>I do not know how it is with others nowadays,
			but I find that this feeling of originality
			in an experience, in my own case, is exceedingly
			hard to keep. It has to be struggled for.</p>

			<p>Of course, one has a theory in a general way
			that one does not want an original mind if he
			has to get it by keeping other people’s minds
			off, and yet there is a certain sense in which if
			he does not do it at certain times—have regular
			periods of keeping other people’s minds off,
			he would lose for life the power of ever finding
			his own under them. Most men one knows
			nowadays, if they were to spend all the rest of
			their lives peeling other men’s minds off, would
			not get down to their own before they died. It
			seems to be supposed that what a mind is for—at
			least in civilisation—is to have other men’s
			minds on top of it.</p>

			<p>It is the same way in books—at least I find
			it so myself when I get to reading in a book,
			reading so fast I cannot stop in it. Nearly all
			books, especially the good ones, have a way of
			overtaking a man—riding his originality down.
			It seems to be assumed that if a man ever did
			get down to his own mind by accident, whether
			in a book or anywhere else, he would not know
			what to do with it.</p>

			<p>And this is not an unreasonable assumption.
			Even the man who gets down to his mind regularly
			hardly knows what to do with it part of
			the time. But it makes having a mind interesting.
			There’s a kind of pleasant, lusty feeling
			<a class="pagenum" id="page313" title="313"> </a>in it—a feeling of reality and honesty that
			makes having a mind—even merely one’s own
			mind—seem almost respectable.</p>

			Reading Backwards</h4>

			<p>Sir Joshua Reynolds gives the precedence to
			the Outside, to authority instead of originality,
			in the early stages of education, because when
			he went to Italy he met the greatest experience
			of his life. He found that much of his originality
			was wrong.</p>

			<p>If Sir Joshua Reynolds had gone to Italy
			earlier he would never have been heard of except
			as a copyist, lecturer, or colour-commentator.
			The real value of Sir Joshua Reynolds’s
			“Discourses on Art” is the man in spite of the
			lecturer. What the man stands for is,—Be
			original. Get headway of personal experience,
			some power of self-teaching. Then when you
			have something to work on, organs that act
			and react on what is presented to them, confront
			your Italy—whatever it may be—and the
			Past, and give yourself over to it. The result
			is paradox and power, a receptive, creative
			man, an obeying and commanding, but self-centred
			and self-poised man, world-open, subject
			to the whole world and yet who has a
			whole world subject to him, either by turns or
			at will.</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page314" title="314"> </a>What Sir Joshua conveys to his pupils is not
			his art, but his mere humility about his art—<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</em>,
			his most belated experience, his finishing
			touch, as an artist.</p>

			<p>The result is that having accidentally received
			an ideal education, having begun his
			education properly, with self-command, he
			completed his career with a kind of Reynoldsocracy—a
			complacent, teachery, levelling-down
			command of others. While Sir Joshua
			Reynolds was an artist, he became one because
			he did not follow his own advice. The fact
			that he would have followed it if he had had
			a chance shows what his art shows, namely,
			that he did not intend to be any more original
			than he could help. It is interesting, however,
			that having acquired the blemish of originality
			in early youth, he never could get rid of enough
			of it before he died, not to be tolerated among
			the immortals.</p>

			<p>His career is in many ways the most striking
			possible illustration of what can be brought to
			pass when a human being without genius is
			by accident brought up with the same principles
			and order of education and training that
			men of genius have—education by one’s self;
			education by others, under the direction of
			one’s self. Sir Joshua Reynolds would have
			been incapable of education by others under
			direction of himself, if he had not been kept ignorant
			and creative and English, long enough
			to get a good start with himself before he went
			<a class="pagenum" id="page315" title="315"> </a>down to Italy to run a race with Five Hundred
			Years. In his naive, almost desperate shame
			over the plight of being almost a genius, he
			overlooks this, but his fame is based upon it.
			He devoted his old age to trying to train young
			men into artists by teaching them to despise
			their youth in their youth, because, when he
			was an old man, he despised his.</p>

			<p>What seems to be necessary is to strike a
			balance, in one’s reading.</p>

			<p>It’s all well enough; indeed, there’s nothing
			better than having one’s originality ridden
			down. One wants it ridden down half the
			time. The trouble comes in making provision
			for catching up, for getting one’s breath after
			it. I have found, for instance, that it has become
			absolutely necessary so far as I am concerned,
			if I am to keep my little mind’s start
			in the world, to begin the day by not reading
			the newspaper in the morning. Unless I can
			get headway—some thought or act or cry or
			joy of my own—something that is definitely in
			my own direction first, there seems to be no
			hope for me all day long. Most people, I
			know, would not agree to this. They like to
			take a swig of all-space, a glance at everybody
			while the world goes round, before they settle
			down to their own little motor on it. They
			like to feel that the world is all right before
			they go ahead. So would I, but I have tried
			it again—and again. The world is too much
			for me in the morning. My own little motor
			<a class="pagenum" id="page316" title="316"> </a>comes to a complete stop. I simply want to
			watch the Big One going round and round. I
			cannot seem to stop somehow—begin puttering
			once more with my Little One. If I begin at
			all, I have to begin at once. In my heart I
			feel the Big One over me all the while, circling
			over me, blessing me. But I keep from noticing.
			I know no other way, and drive on. The
			world is getting to be—has to be—to me a
			purely afternoon or evening affair. I have a
			world of my own for morning use. I hold to
			it, one way or the other, with a cheerful smile
			or like grim death, until the clock says twelve
			and the sun turns the corner, and the book
			drops. It does not seem to make very much
			difference what kind of a world I am in, or
			what is going on in it, so that it is all my own,
			and the only way I know to do, is to say or
			read or write or use the things first in it which
			make it my own the most. The one thing I
			want in the morning is to let my soul light its
			own light, appropriate some one thing, glow it
			through with itself. When I have satisfied the
			hunger for making a bit of the great world over
			into my world, I am ready for the world as a
			world—streets and newspapers of it,—silent
			and looking, in it, until sleep falls.</p>

			<p>It is because men lie down under it, allow
			themselves to be rolled over by it, that the
			modern newspaper, against its will, has become
			the great distracting machine of modern times.
			As I live and look about me, everywhere I find
			<a class="pagenum" id="page317" title="317"> </a>a great running to and fro of editors across the
			still earth. Every editor has his herd, is a
			kind of bell-wether, has a great paper herd
			flocking at his heels. “Is not the world
			here?” I say, “and am I not here to look at
			it? Can I really see a world better by joining
			a Cook’s Excursion on it, sweeping round the
			earth in a column, seeing everything in a column,
			looking over the shoulder of a crowd?”
			Sometimes it seems as if the whole modern,
			reading, book-and-paper outfit were simply a
			huge, crunching Mass-Machine—a machine for
			arranging every man’s mind from the outside.</p>

			<p>Originality may be said to depend upon a
			balance of two things, the power of being interested
			in other people’s minds and the power
			of being more interested in one’s own. In its
			last analysis, it is the power a man’s mind has
			of minding its own business, which, even in
			another man’s book, makes the book real and
			absorbing to him. It is the least compliment
			one can pay a book. The only honest way to
			commune with a real man either in a book or
			out of it is to do one’s own share of talking.
			Both the book and the man say better things
			when talked back to. In reading a great book
			one finds it allows for this. In reading a poor
			one the only way to make it worth while, to
			find anything in it, is to put it there. The
			most self-respecting course when one finds
			one’s self in the middle of a poor book is to
			turn right around in it, and write it one’s self.
			<a class="pagenum" id="page318" title="318"> </a>As has been said by Hoffentotter (in the fourteenth
			chapter of his great masterpiece): “If
			you find that you cannot go on, gentle reader,
			in the reading of this book, pray read it backwards.”</p>

			<p>The original man, the man who insists on
			keeping the power in a mind of minding its
			own business, is much more humble than he
			looks. All he feels is, that his mind has been
			made more convenient to him than to anybody
			else and that if anyone is going to use it, he
			must. It is not a matter of assuming that one’s
			own mind is superior. A very poor mind, on
			the premises, put right in with one’s own body,
			carefully fitted to it, to one’s very nerves and
			senses, is worth all the other minds in the
			world. It may be conceit to believe this, and
			it may be self-preservation. But, in any case,
			keeping up an interest in one’s own mind is
			excusable. Even the humblest man must admit
			that the first, the most economical, the
			most humble, the most necessary thing for a
			man to do in reading in this world (if he can
			do it) is to keep up an interest in his own mind.</p>

			Calling the Meeting to Order</h4>

			<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">Reading</span> for persons makes a man a poet
			or artist, makes him dramatic with his
			mind—puts the world-stage into him.</p>

			<p>Reading for principles makes a man a philosopher.
			Reading for facts makes a <span class="keep_together">man——</span></p>

			<p>“It doesn’t make a man,” spoke up the
			Mysterious Person.</p>

			<p>“Oh, yes,” I said, “if he reads a few of
			them—if he takes time to do something with
			them—he can make a man out of them, if he
			wants to, as well as anything else.”</p>

			<p>The great trouble with scientific people and
			others who are always reading for facts is that
			they forget what facts are for. They use their
			minds as museums. They are like Ole Bill
			<a class="pagenum" id="page320" title="320"> </a>Spear. They take you up into their garret
			and point to a bushel-basketful of something
			and then to another bushel-basket half-full of
			some more. Then they say in deep tones and
			with solemn faces: “This is the largest collection
			of burnt matches in the world.”</p>

			<p>It’s what reading for facts brings a man to,
			generally—fact for fact’s sake. He lunges
			along for facts wherever he goes. He cannot
			stop. All an outsider can do in such cases,
			with nine out of ten scientific or collecting
			minds, is to watch them sadly in a dull, trance-like,
			helpless inertia of facts, sliding on to
			Ignorance.</p>

			<p>What seems to be most wanted in reading for
			facts in a world as large as this is some reasonable
			principle of economy. The great problem
			of reading for facts—travelling with one’s
			mind—is the baggage problem. To have every
			fact that one needs and to throw away every
			fact that one can get along without, is the
			secret of having a comfortable and practicable,
			live, happy mind in modern knowledge—a
			mind that gets somewhere—that gets the
			hearts of things.</p>

			<p>The best way to arrange this seems to be to
			have a sentinel in one’s mind in reading.</p>

			<p>Every man finds in his intellectual life,
			sooner or later, that there are certain orders
			and kinds of facts that have a way of coming
			to him of their own accord and without being
			asked. He is half amused sometimes and half
			<a class="pagenum" id="page321" title="321"> </a>annoyed by them. He has no particular use
			for them. He dotes on them some, perhaps,
			pets them a little—tells them to go away, but
			they keep coming back. Apropos of nothing,
			in the way of everything, they keep hanging
			about while he attends to the regular business
			of his brain, and say: “Why don’t you do
			something with Me?”</p>

			<p>What I would like to be permitted to do in
			this chapter is to say a good word for these
			involuntary, helpless, wistful facts that keep
			tagging a man’s mind around. I know that I
			am exposing myself in standing up for them to
			the accusation that I have a mere irrelevant,
			sideways, intellectually unbusinesslike sort of
			a mind. I can see my championship even
			now being gently but firmly set one side.
			“It’s all of a piece—this pleasant, yielding
			way with ideas,” people say. “It goes with
			the slovenly, lazy, useless, polite state of mind
			always, and the general ball-bearing view of
			life.”</p>

			<p>It seems to me that if a man has a few involuntary,
			instinctive facts about him, facts that
			fasten themselves on to his thoughts whether
			he wants them there or not, facts that keep on
			working for him of their own accord, down
			under the floor of his mind, passing things up,
			running invisible errands for him, making
			short-cuts for him—it seems to me that if a
			man has a few facts like this in him, facts that
			serve him like the great involuntary servants of
			<a class="pagenum" id="page322" title="322"> </a>Nature, whether they are noticed or not, he
			ought to find it worth his while to do something
			in return, conduct his life with reference
			to them. They ought to have the main chance
			at him. It seems reasonable also that his reading
			should be conducted with reference to
			them.</p>

			<p>It is no mere literary prejudice, and it seems
			to be a truth for the scientist as well as for the
			poet, that the great involuntary facts in a man’s
			life, the facts he does not select, the facts that
			select him, the facts that say to him, “Come
			thou and live with us, make a human life out
			of us that men may know us,” are the facts of
			all others which ought to have their way sooner
			or later in the great struggling mass-meeting
			of his mind. I have read equally in vain the
			lives of the great scientists and the lives of the
			great artists and makers, if they are not all
			alike in this, that certain great facts have been
			yielded to, have been made the presiding officers,
			the organisers of their minds. In so far
			as they have been great, no facts have been
			suppressed and all facts have been represented;
			but I doubt if there has ever been a life of a
			powerful mind yet in which a few great facts
			and a great man were not seen mutually attracted
			to each other, day and night,—getting
			themselves made over into each other, mutually
			mastering the world.</p>

			<p>Certainly, if there is one token rather than
			another of the great scientist or poet in distinction
			<a class="pagenum" id="page323" title="323"> </a>from the small scientist or poet, it is the
			courage with which he yields himself, makes
			his whole being sensitive and free before his
			instinctive facts, gives himself fearless up to
			them, allows them to be the organisers of his
			mind.</p>

			<p>It seems to be the only possible way in reading
			for facts that the mind of a man can come
			to anything; namely, by always having a
			chairman (and a few alternates appointed for
			life) to call the meeting to order.</p>

		<div id="section_3.4.2" class="section">

			Symbolic Facts</h4>

			<p>If the meeting is to accomplish anything before
			it adjourns <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine die</em>, everything depends
			upon the gavel in it, upon there being some
			power in it that makes some facts sit down and
			others stand up, but which sees that all facts
			are represented.</p>

			<p>In general, the more facts a particular fact
			can be said to be a delegate for, the more a
			particular fact can be said to represent other
			facts, the more of the floor it should have.
			The power of reading for facts depends upon a
			man’s power to recognise symbolic or sum-total
			or senatorial facts and keep all other facts, the
			general mob or common run of facts, from interrupting.
			The amount of knowledge a man
			is going to be able to master in the world
			<a class="pagenum" id="page324" title="324"> </a>depends upon the number of facts he knows
			how to avoid.</p>

			<p>This is where our common scientific training—the
			manufacturing of small scientists in
			the bulk—breaks down. The first thing that
			is done with a young man nowadays, if he is
			to be made into a scientist, is to take away any
			last vestige of power his mind may have of
			avoiding facts. Everyone has seen it, and yet
			we know perfectly well when we stop to think
			about it that when in the course of his being
			educated a man’s ability to avoid facts is taken
			away from him, it soon ceases to make very
			much difference whether he is educated or not.
			He becomes a mere memory let loose in the
			universe—goes about remembering everything,
			hit or miss. I never see one of these memory-machines
			going about mowing things down
			remembering them, but that it gives me a kind
			of sad, sudden feeling of being intelligent. I
			cannot quite describe the feeling. I am part
			sorry and part glad and part ashamed of being
			glad. It depends upon what one thinks of,
			one’s own narrow escape or the other man, or
			the way of the world. All one can do is to
			thank God, silently, in some safe place in one’s
			thoughts, that after all there is a great deal
			of the human race—always is—in every generation
			who by mere circumstance cannot be educated—bowled
			over by their memories. Even
			at the worst only a few hundred persons can be
			made over into <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">reductio-ad-absurdum</em> Stanley
			<a class="pagenum" id="page325" title="325"> </a>Halls (that is, study science under pupils of

			are even now, as bad as things are and are getting

			Man, the Big Brother of creation, will insist on
			preserving his special distinction in it, the
			thing that has lifted him above the other animals—his

			Duplicates: A Principle of Economy</h4>

			<p>I do not suppose that anybody would submit
			to my being admitted—I was black-balled before
			I was born—to the brotherhood of scientists.
			And yet it seems to me that there is a
			certain sense in which I am as scientific as
			anyone. It seems to me, for instance, that it
			is a fairly scientific thing to do—a fairly matter-of-fact
			thing—to consider the actual nature
			of facts and to act on it. When one considers
			the actual nature of facts, the first thing one
			notices is that there are too many of them.
			The second thing one notices about facts is
			that they are not so many as they look. They
			are mostly duplicates. The small scientist
			never thinks of this because he never looks at
			more than one class of facts, never allows himself
			to fall into any general, interesting, fact-comparing
			habit. The small poet never thinks
			<a class="pagenum" id="page326" title="326"> </a>of it because he never looks at facts at all. It
			is thus that it has come to pass that the most
			ordinary human being, just living along, the
			man who has the habit of general information,
			is the intellectual superior of the mere scientists
			about him or the mere poets. He is superior
			to the mere poet because he is interested in
			knowing facts, and he is superior to the minor
			scientist because he does not want to know all
			of them, or at least if he does, he never has
			time to try to, and so keeps on knowing something.</p>

			<p>When one considers the actual nature of
			facts, it is obvious that the only possible model
			for a scientist of the first class or a poet of the
			first class in this world, is the average man.
			The only way to be an extraordinary man,
			master of more of the universe than any one
			else, is to keep out of the two great pits God
			has made in it, in which The Educated are
			thrown away—the science-pit and the poet-pit.
			The area and power and value of a man’s knowledge
			depend upon his having such a boundless
			interest in facts that he will avoid all facts he
			knows already and go on to new ones. The
			rapidity of a man’s education depends upon his
			power to scent a duplicate fact afar off and to
			keep from stopping and puttering with it. Is
			not one fact out of a thousand about a truth as
			good as the other nine hundred and ninety-nine
			to enjoy it with? If there were not any more
			truths or if there were not so many more things
			<a class="pagenum" id="page327" title="327"> </a>to enjoy in this world than one had time for,
			it would be different. It would be superficial,
			I admit, not to climb down into a well and collect
			some more of the same facts about it, or
			not to crawl under a stone somewhere and
			know what we know already—a little harder.
			But as it is—well, it does seem to me that
			when a man has collected one good, representative
			fact about a thing, or at most two, it is
			about time to move on and enjoy some of the
			others. There is not a man living dull enough,
			it seems to me, to make it worth while to do
			any other way. There is not a man living who
			can afford, in a world made as this one is, to
			know any more facts than he can help. Are
			not facts plenty enough in the world? Are
			they not scattered everywhere? And there are
			not men enough to go around. Let us take
			our one fact apiece and be off, and be men with
			it. There is always one fact about everything
			which is the spirit of all the rest, the fact a
			man was intended to know and to go on his
			way rejoicing with. It may be superficial
			withal and merely spiritual, but if there is anything
			worth while in this world to me, it is not
			to miss any part of being a man in it that any
			other man has had. I do not want to know
			what every man knows, but I do want to get
			the best of what he knows and live every day
			with it. Oh, to take all knowledge for one’s
			province, to have rights with all facts, to be
			naive and unashamed before the universe, to
			<a class="pagenum" id="page328" title="328"> </a>go forth fearlessly to know God in it, to make
			the round of creation before one dies, to share
			all that has been shared, to be all that is, to go
			about in space saying halloa to one’s soul in it,
			in the stars and in the flowers and in children’s
			faces, is not this to have lived,—that there
			should be nothing left out in a man’s life that
			all the world has had?</p>

			The Blank Paper Frame of Mind</h4>

			<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">The</span> P. G. S. of M. read a paper in our club
			the other day which he called “Reading
			for Results.” It was followed by a somewhat
			warm discussion, in the course of which so
			many things were said that were not so that
			the entire club (before any one knew it) had
			waked up and learned something.</p>

			<p>The P. G. S. of M. took the general ground
			that most of the men one knows nowadays had
			never learned to read. They read wastefully.
			Our common schools and colleges, he thought,
			ought to teach a young man to read with a
			purpose. “When an educated young man
			takes up a book,” he said, “he should feel
			that he has some business in it, and attend to
			it.”</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page330" title="330"> </a>I said I thought young men nowadays read
			with purposes too much. Purposes were all
			they had to read with. “When a man feels
			that he needs a purpose in front of him, to go
			through a book with, when he goes about in a
			book looking over the edge of a purpose at
			everything, the chances are that he is missing
			nine tenths of what the book has to give.”</p>

			<p>The P. G. S. of M. thought that one tenth
			was enough. He didn’t read a book to get
			nine tenths of an author. He read it to get
			the one tenth he wanted—to find out which it
			was.</p>

			<p>I asked him which tenth of Shakespeare he
			wanted. He said that sometimes he wanted
			one tenth and sometimes another.</p>

			<p>“That is just it,” I said. “Everybody
			does. It is at the bottom and has been at the
			bottom of the whole Shakespeare nuisance for
			three hundred years. Every literary man we
			have or have had seems to feel obliged somehow
			to read Shakespeare in tenths. Generally
			he thinks he ought to publish his tenth—make
			a streak across Shakespeare with his soul—before
			he feels literary or satisfied or feels that
			he has a place in the world. One hardly knows
			a man who calls himself really literary, who
			reads Shakespeare nowadays except with a
			purpose, with some little side-show of his own
			mind. It is true that there are still some people—not
			very many perhaps—but we all know
			some people who can be said to understand
			<a class="pagenum" id="page331" title="331"> </a>Shakespeare, who never get so low in their
			minds as to have to read him with a purpose;
			but they are not prominent.</p>

			<p>“And yet there is hardly any man who would
			deny that at best his reading with a purpose
			is almost always his more anæmic, official,
			unresourceful, reading. It is like putting a
			small tool to a book and whittling on it, instead
			of putting one’s whole self to it. One
			might as well try to read most of Shakespeare’s
			plays with a screw-driver or with a wrench as
			with a purpose. There is no purpose large
			enough, that one is likely to find, to connect
			with them. Shakespeare himself could not
			have found one when he wrote them in any
			small or ordinary sense. The one possible
			purpose in producing a work of art—in any
			age—is to praise the universe with it, love
			something with it, talk back to life with it,
			and the man who attempts to read what Shakespeare
			writes with any smaller or less general,
			less overflowing purpose than Shakespeare had
			in writing it should be advised to do his reading
			with some smaller, more carefully fitted
			author,—one nearer to his size. Of course if
			one wants to be a mere authority on Shakespeare
			or a mere author there is no denying
			that one can do it, and do it very well, by reading
			him with some purpose—some purpose that
			is too small to have ever been thought of before;
			but if one wants to understand him, get
			the wild native flavour and power of him, he
			<a class="pagenum" id="page332" title="332"> </a>must be read in a larger, more vital and open
			and resourceful spirit—as a kind of spiritual
			adventure. Half the joy of a great man, like
			any other great event, is that one can well afford—at
			least for once—to let one’s purposes go.</p>

			<p>“To feel one’s self lifted out, carried along,
			if only for a little time, into some vast stream of
			consciousness, to feel great spaces around one’s
			human life, to float out into the universe, to
			bathe in it, to taste it with every pore of one’s
			body and all one’s soul—this is the one supreme
			thing that the reading of a man like William
			Shakespeare is for. To interrupt the stream
			with dams, to make it turn wheels,—intellectual
			wheels (mostly pin-wheels and theories) or any
			wheels whatever,—is to cut one’s self off from
			the last chance of knowing the real Shakespeare
			at all. A man knows Shakespeare in proportion
			as he gives himself, in proportion as he
			lets Shakespeare make a Shakespeare of him, a
			little while. As long as he is reading in the
			Shakespeare universe his one business in it is
			to live in it. He may do no mighty work
			there,—pile up a commentary or throw on a
			footnote,—but he will be a mighty work himself
			if he let William Shakespeare work on
			him some. Before he knows it the universe
			that Shakespeare lived in becomes his universe.
			He feels the might of that universe
			being gathered over to him, descending upon
			him being breathed into him day and night—to
			belong to him always.</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page333" title="333"> </a>“The power and effect of a book which is a
			real work of art seems always to consist in the
			way it has of giving the nature of things a
			chance at a man, of keeping things open to the
			sun and air of thought. To those who cannot
			help being interested, it is a sad sight to stand
			by with the typical modern man—especially a
			student—and watch him go blundering about
			in a great book, cooping it up with purposes.”</p>

			<p>The P. G. S. of M. remarked somewhere at
			about this point that it seemed to him that it
			made a great difference who an author or reader
			was. He suggested that my theory of reading
			with a not-purpose worked rather better with
			Shakespeare than with the <cite>Encyclopedia Britannica</cite>
			or the Hon. Carroll D. Wright, Commissioner
			of Statistics, or Ella Wheeler Wilcox.</p>

			<p>I admitted that in reading dictionaries, statistics,
			or mere poets or mere scientists it was
			necessary to have a purpose to fall back upon
			to justify one’s self. And there was no denying
			that reading for results was a necessary and
			natural thing. The trouble seemed to be, that
			very few people could be depended on to pick
			out the right results. Most people cannot be
			depended upon to pick out even the right directions
			in reading a great book. It has to be
			left to the author. It could be categorically
			proved that the best results in this world, either
			in books or in life, had never been attained by
			men who always insisted on doing their own
			steering. The special purpose of a great book
			<a class="pagenum" id="page334" title="334"> </a>is that a man can stop steering in it, that one
			can give one’s self up to the undertow, to the
			cross-current in it. One feels one’s self swept
			out into the great struggling human stream
			that flows under life. One comes to truths and
			delights at last that no man, though he had a
			thousand lives, could steer to. Most of us are
			not clear-headed or far-sighted enough to pick
			out purposes or results in reading. We are
			always forgetting how great we are. We do
			not pick out results—and could not if we tried—that
			are big enough.</p>

			The Usefully Unfinished</h4>

			<p>The P. G. S. of M. remarked that he thought
			there was such a thing as having purposes in
			reading that were too big. It seemed to him
			that a man who spent nearly all his strength
			when he was reading a book, in trying to use it
			to swallow a universe with, must find it monotonous.
			He said he had tried reading a great
			book without any purpose whatever except its
			tangents or suggestions, and he claimed that
			when he read a great book in that way—the
			average great book—the monotone of innumerable
			possibility wore on him. He wanted
			to feel that a book was coming to something,
			and if he couldn’t feel in reading it that the
			book was coming to something he wanted to
			<a class="pagenum" id="page335" title="335"> </a>feel at least that he was. He did not say it in
			so many words, but he admitted he did not
			care very much in reading for what I had
			spoken of as a “stream of consciousness.” He
			wanted a nozzle on it.</p>

			<p>I asked him at this point how he felt in reading
			certain classics. I brought out quite a nice
			little list of them, but I couldn’t track him
			down to a single feeling he had thought of—had
			had to think of, all by himself, on a classic.
			I found he had all the proper feelings about
			them and a lot of well-regulated qualifications
			besides. He was on his guard. Finally I
			asked him if he had read (I am not going to
			get into trouble by naming it) a certain contemporary
			novel under discussion.</p>

			<p>He said he had read it. “Great deal of
			power in it,” he said. “But it doesn’t come
			to anything. I do not see any possible artistic
			sense,” he said, “in ending a novel like that.
			It doesn’t bring one anywhere.”</p>

			<p>“Neither does one of Keats’s poems,” I said,
			“or Beethoven’s <cite>Ninth Symphony</cite>. The odour
			of a rose doesn’t come to anything—bring one
			anywhere. It would be hard to tell what one
			really gets out of the taste of roast beef. The
			sound of the surf on the Atlantic doesn’t come
			to anything, but hundreds of people travel a
			long way and live in one-windowed rooms and
			rock in somebody else’s bedroom rocker, to
			hear it, year after year. Millions of dollars are
			spent in Europe to look at pictures, but if a
			<a class="pagenum" id="page336" title="336"> </a>man can tell what it is he gets out of a picture
			in so many words there is something very
			wrong with the picture.”</p>

			<p>The P. G. S. of M. gave an impatient wave
			of his hand. (To be strictly accurate, he gave
			it in the middle of the last paragraph, just before
			we came to the Atlantic. The rest is Congressional
			Record.) And after he had given
			the impatient wave of his hand he looked hurt.
			I accordingly drew him out. He was still
			brooding on that novel. He didn’t approve of
			the heroine.</p>

			<p>“What was the matter?” I said; “dying in
			the last chapter?” (It is one of those novels
			in which the heroine takes the liberty of dying,
			in a mere paragraph, at the end, and in what
			always has seemed and always will, to some
			people, a rather unsatisfactory and unfinished
			manner.)</p>

			<p>“The moral and spiritual issues of a book
			ought to be—well, things are all mixed up.
			She dies indefinitely.”</p>

			<p>“Most women do,” I said. I asked him
			how many funerals of women—wives and
			mothers—he had been to in the course of his
			life where he could sit down and really think
			that they had died to the point—the way they
			do in novels. I didn’t see why people should
			be required by critics and other authorities, to
			die to the point in a book more than anywhere
			else. It is this shallow, reckless way that
			readers have of wanting to have everything
			<a class="pagenum" id="page337" title="337"> </a>pleasant and appropriate when people die in
			novels which makes writing a novel nowadays
			as much as a man’s reputation is worth.</p>

			<p>The P. G. S. of M. explained that it wasn’t
			exactly the way she died but it was the way
			everything was left—left to the imagination.</p>

			<p>I said I was sorry for any human being who
			had lived in a world like this who didn’t leave
			a good deal to the imagination when he died.
			The dullest, most uninteresting man that any
			one can ever know becomes interesting in his
			death. One walks softly down the years of his
			life, peering through them. One cannot help
			loving him a little—stealthily. One goes out
			a little way with him on his long journey—feels
			bound in with him at last—actually bound
			in with him (it is like a promise) for ever. The
			more one knows about people’s lives in this
			world, the more indefinitely, the more irrelevantly,—sometimes
			almost comically, or as a
			kind of an aside, or a bit of repartee,—they end
			them. Suddenly, sometimes while we laugh
			or look, they turn upon us, fling their souls
			upon the invisible, and are gone. It is like a
			last wistful haunting pleasantry—death is—from
			some of us, a kind of bravado in it—as
			one would say, “Oh, well, dying is really after
			all—having been allowed one look at a world
			like this—a small matter.”</p>

			<p>It is true that most people in most novels,
			never having been born, do not really need to
			die—that is, if they are logical,—and they
			<a class="pagenum" id="page338" title="338"> </a>might as well die to the point or as the reader
			likes as in any other way, but if there is one
			sign rather than another that a novel belongs
			to the first class, it is that the novelist claims
			all the privileges of the stage of the world in it.
			He refuses to write a little parlour of a book
			and he sees that his people die the way they
			live, leaving as much left over to the imagination
			as they know how.</p>

			<p>That there are many reasons for the habit of
			reading for results, as it is called, goes without
			saying. It also goes without saying—that is,
			no one is saying very much about it—that the
			habit of reading for results, such as it is, has
			taken such a grim hold on the modern American
			mind that the greatest result of all in reading,
			the result in a book that cannot be spoken
			in it, or even out of it, is being unanimously
			missed.</p>

			<p>The fact seems to need to be emphasised that
			the novel which gives itself to one to be
			breathed and lived, the novel which leaves a
			man with something that he must finish himself,
			with something he must do and be, is the
			one which “gets a man somewhere” most of
			all. It is the one which ends the most definitely
			and practically.</p>

			<p>When a novel, instead of being hewn out,
			finished, and decorated by the author,—added
			as one more monument or tomb of itself in a
			man’s memory,—becomes a growing, living
			daily thing to him, the wondering, unfinished
			<a class="pagenum" id="page339" title="339"> </a>events of it, and the unfinished people of it,
			flocking out to him, interpreting for him the
			still unfinished events and all the dear unfinished
			people that jostle in his own life,—it
			is a great novel.</p>

			<p>It seems to need to be recalled that the one
			possible object of a human being’s life in a
			novel (as out of it) is to be loved. This is
			definite enough. It is the novel in which the
			heroine looks finished that does not come to
			anything. I always feel a little grieved and
			frustrated—as if human nature had been blasphemed
			a little in my presence—if a novel finishes
			its people or thinks it can. It is a small
			novel which finishes love—and lays it away;
			which makes me love say one brave woman or
			mother in a book, and close her away for ever.
			The greater novel makes me love one woman
			in a book in such a way that I go about
			through all the world seeking for her—knowing
			and loving a thousand women through
			her. I feel the secret of their faces—through
			her—flickering by me on the street. This
			intangible result, this eternal flash of a life
			upon life is all that reading is for. It is practical
			because it is eternal and cannot be wasted
			and because it is for ever to the point.</p>

			<p>Life is greater than art and art is great only
			in so far as it proves that life is greater than
			art, interprets and intensifies life and the power
			to taste life—makes us live wider and deeper
			and farther in our seventy years.</p>

			Athletics</h4>

			<p>“The world is full,” Ellery Charming used to
			say, “of fools who get a-going and never stop.
			Set them off on another tack, and they are
			half-cured.” There are grave reasons to believe
			that, if an archangel were to come to this
			earth and select a profession on it, instead of
			taking up some splendid, serious, dignified calling
			he would devote himself to a comparatively
			small and humble-looking career—that of jogging
			people’s minds. This might not seem at
			first sight to be a sufficiently large thing for
			an archangel to do, but if it were to be done at
			all (those who have tried it think) it would
			take an archangel to do it.</p>

			<p>The only possible practical or businesslike
			substitute one can think of in modern life for
			an archangel would have to be an Institution
			of some kind. Some huge, pleasant Mutual
			Association for Jogging People’s Minds might
			do a little something perhaps, but it would not
			be very thorough. The people who need it
			most, half or three-quarters of them, the treadmill-conscientious,
			dear, rutty, people of this
			world, would not be touched by it. What is
			really wanted, if anything is really to be done
			in the way of jogging, is a new day in the
			week.</p>

			<p>I have always thought that there ought to
			<a class="pagenum" id="page341" title="341"> </a>be a day, one day in the week, to do wrong in—not
			very wrong, but wrong enough to answer
			the purpose—a perfectly irresponsible, delectable,
			inconsequent day—a sabbath of whims.
			There ought to be a sort of sabbath for things
			that never get done because they are too good
			or not good enough. Letters that ought to be
			postponed until others are written, letters to
			friends that never dun, books that don’t bear
			on anything, books that no one has asked one
			to read, calls on unexpecting people, bills that
			might just as well wait, tinkering around the
			house on the wrong things, the right ones, perfectly
			helpless, standing by. Sitting with one’s
			feet a little too high (if possible on one’s working
			desk), being a little foolish and liking it—making
			poor puns, enjoying one’s bad grammar—a
			day, in short, in which, whatever a
			man is, he rests from himself and play marbles
			with his soul.</p>

			<p>Most people nowadays—at least the intellectual,
			so-called, and the learned above all
			others—are so far gone under the reading-for-results
			theory that they have become mere
			work-worshippers in books, worshippers of
			work which would not need to be performed at
			all—most of it—by men with healthy natural
			or fully exercised spiritual organs. One very
			seldom catches a man in the act nowadays of
			doing any old-fashioned or important reading.
			The old idea of reading for athletics instead of
			scientifics has almost no provision made for it
			<a class="pagenum" id="page342" title="342"> </a>in the modern intellectual man’s life. He
			does not seem to know what it is to take his
			rest like a gentleman. He lunges between all-science
			and all-vaudeville, and plays in his
			way, it is true, but he never plays with his
			mind. He never takes playing with a mind
			seriously, as one of the great standard joys and
			powers and equipments of human life. He
			does not seem to love his mind enough to play
			with it. Above all, he does not see that playing
			with a mind (on great subjects, at least) is
			the only possible way to make it work. He
			entirely overlooks the fact, in his little round
			of reading for results, that the main thing a
			book is in a man’s hands for is the man—that
			it is there to lift him over into a state of
			being, a power of action. A man who really
			reads a book and reads it well, reads it for
			moral muscle, spiritual skill, for far-sightedness,
			for catholicity—above all for a kind of
			limberness and suppleness, a swift sure strength
			through his whole being. He faces the world
			with a new face when he has truly read a true
			book, and as a bridegroom coming out of his
			chamber, he rejoices as a strong man to run a
			race.</p>

			<p>As between reading to heighten one’s senses,
			one’s suggestibility, power of knowing and
			combining facts, the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">multum-in-parvo</em> method
			in reading, and the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">parvum-in-multo</em> method,
			a dogged, accumulating, impotent, callous
			reading for results, it is not hard to say which,
			<a class="pagenum" id="page343" title="343"> </a>in the equipment of the modern scientist, is
			being overlooked.</p>

			<p>It is doubtless true, the common saying of
			the man of genius in every age, that “everything
			is grist to his mill,” but it would not be
			if he could not grind it fine enough. And he
			is only able to grind it fine enough because he
			makes his reading bring him power as well as
			grist. Having provided for energy, stored-up
			energy for grinding, he guards and preserves
			that energy as the most important and culminating
			thing in his intellectual life. He insists
			on making provision for it. He makes ready
			solitude for it, blankness, reverie, sleep, silence.
			He cultivates the general habit not only of rejecting
			things, but of keeping out of their way
			when necessary, so as not to have to reject
			them, and he knows the passion in all times
			and all places for grinding grist finer instead
			of gathering more grist. These are going to
			be the traits of all the mighty reading, the
			reading that achieves, in the twentieth century.
			The saying of the man of genius that
			everything is grist to his mill merely means
			that he reads a book athletically, with a magnificent
			play of power across it, with an heroic
			imagination or power of putting together. He
			turns everything that comes to him over into
			its place and force and meaning in everything
			else. He reads slowly and organically where
			others read with their eyes. He knows what
			it is to tingle with a book, to blush and turn
			<a class="pagenum" id="page344" title="344"> </a>pale with it, to read his feet cold. He reads
			all over, with his nerves and senses, with his
			mind and heart. He reads through the whole
			tract of his digestive and assimilative nature.
			To borrow the Hebrew figure, he reads with
			his bowels. Instead of reading to maintain a
			theory, or a row of facts, he reads to sustain a
			certain state of being. The man who has the
			knack, as some people seem to think it, of
			making everything he reads and sees beautiful
			or vigorous and practical, does not need
			to try to do it. He does it because he has
			a habit of putting himself in a certain state
			of being and cannot help doing it. He does
			not need to spend a great deal of time in reading
			for results. He produces his own results.
			The less athletic reader, the smaller poet or
			scientist, confines himself to reading for results,
			for ready-made beauty and ready-made facts,
			because he is not in condition to do anything
			else. The greater poet or scientist is an energy,
			a transfigurer, a transmuter of everything into
			beauty and truth. Everything having passed
			through the heat and light of his own being
			is fused and seen where it belongs, where God
			placed it when He made it, in some relation to
			everything else.</p>

			<p>I fear that I may have come, in bearing
			down on this point, to another of the of-course
			places in this book. It is not just to assume
			that because people are not living with a truth
			that they need to be told it. It is of little use,
			<a class="pagenum" id="page345" title="345"> </a>when a man has used his truth all up boring
			people with it, to try to get them (what is left
			of the truth and the people) to do anything
			about it. But if I may be allowed one page
			more I would like to say in the present epidemic
			of educating for results, just what a
			practical education may be said to be.</p>

			<p>The indications are that the more a man
			spends, makes himself able to spend, a large
			part of his time, as Whitman did, in standing
			still and looking around and loving things, the
			more practical he is. Even if a man’s life were
			to serve as a mere guide-board to the universe,
			it would supply to all who know him the main
			thing the universe seems to be without. But
			a man who, like Walt Whitman, is more than
			a guide-board to the universe, who deliberately
			takes time to live in the whole of it, who becomes
			a part of the universe to all who live
			always, who makes the universe human to us—companionable,—such
			a man may not be able
			to fix a latch on a kitchen door, but I can only
			say for one that if there is a man who can lift
			a universe bodily, and set it down in my front
			yard where I can feel it helping me do my
			work all day and guarding my sleep at night,
			that man is practical. Who can say he does
			not “come to anything”? To have heard it
			rumoured that such a man has lived, can live,
			is a result—the most practical result of all to
			most of the workers of the world. A bare fact
			about such a man is a gospel. Why work for
			<a class="pagenum" id="page346" title="346"> </a>nothing (that is, with no result) in a universe
			where you can play for nothing—and by playing
			earn everything?</p>

			<p>Such a man is not only practical, serving
			those who know him by merely being, but he
			serves all men always. They will not let him
			go. He becomes a part of the structure of the
			world. The generations keep flocking to him
			the way they flock to the great sane silent
			ministries of the sky and of the earth. Their
			being drawn to them is their being drawn to
			him. The strength of clouds is in him, and
			the spirit of falling water, and he knoweth the
			way of the wind. When a man can be said by
			the way he lives his life to have made himself
			the companion of his unborn brothers and of
			God; when he can be said to have made himself,
			not a mere scientist, but a younger brother,
			a real companion of air, water, fire, mist, and
			of the great gentle ground beneath his feet—he
			has secured a result.</p>

		<div id="section_3.6.1" class="section">
			<h4 class="section_title"><abbr class="section_number" title="one">I</abbr><br/>
			The Passion of Truth</h4>

			<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">Reading</span> resolves itself sooner or later
			into two elements in the reader’s mind:</p>

			<p>1. Tables of facts. (a) Rows of raw fact;
				(b) Principles, spiritual or sum-total facts.</p>
			<p>2. Feelings about the facts.</p>

			<p>But the Man with the Scientific Method,
			who lives just around the corner from me, tells
			me that reading for feelings is quite out of the
			question for a scientific mind. It is foreign to
			the nature of knowledge to want knowledge
			for the feelings that go with it. Feelings get
			in the way.</p>

			<p>I find it impossible not to admit that there
			is a certain force in this, but I notice that when
			the average small scientist, the man around
			the corner, for instance, says to me what he is
			<a class="pagenum" id="page348" title="348"> </a>always saying, “Science requires the elimination
			of feelings,”—says it to me in his usual
			chilled-through, ophidian, infallible way,—I
			never believe it, or at least I believe it very
			softly and do not let him know it. But when
			a large scientist, a man like Charles Darwin,
			makes a statement like this, I believe it as hard,
			I notice, as if I had made it all up myself.
			The statement that science requires the elimination
			of the feelings is true or not true, it
			seems to me, according to the size of the feelings.
			Considering what most men’s feelings
			are, a man like Darwin feels that they had
			better be eliminated. If a man’s feelings are
			small feelings, they are in the way in science,
			as a matter of course. If he has large noble
			ones, feelings that match the things that God
			has made, feelings that are free and daring,
			beautiful enough to belong with things that a
			God has made, he will have no trouble with
			them. It is the feelings in a great scientist
			which have always fired him into being a man
			of genius in his science, instead of a mere tool,
			or scoop, or human dredge of truth. All the
			great scientists show this firing-process down
			underneath, in their work. The idea that it
			is necessary for a scientific man to give up his
			human ideal, that it is necessary for him to be
			officially brutal, in his relation to nature, to
			become a professional nobody in order to get
			at truth, to make himself over into matter in
			order to understand matter, has not had a
			<a class="pagenum" id="page349" title="349"> </a>single great scientific achievement or conception
			to its credit. All great insight or genius
			in science is a passion of itself, a passion of
			worshipping real things. Science is a passion
			not only in its origin, but in its motive power
			and in its end. The real truth seems to be
			that the scientist of the greater sort is great,
			not by having no emotions, but by having disinterested
			emotions, by being large enough to
			have emotions on both sides and all sides, all
			held in subjection to the final emotion of truth.
			Having a disinterested, fair attitude in truth is
			not a matter of having no passions, but of having
			passions enough to go around. The temporary
			idea that a scientist cannot be scientific
			and emotional at once is based upon the experience
			of men who have never had emotions
			enough. Men whose emotions are slow and
			weak, who have one-sided or wavering emotions,
			find them inconvenient as a matter of
			course. The men who, like Charles Darwin or
			some larger Browning, have the passion of disinterestedness
			are those who are fitted to lead
			the human race, who are going to lead it along
			the paths of space and the footsteps of the
			worlds into the Great Presence.</p>

			<p>The greatest astronomer or chemist is the
			man who glows with the joy of wrestling with
			God, of putting strength to strength.</p>

			<p>To the geologist who goes groping about in
			stones, his whole life is a kind of mind-reading
			of the ground, a passion for getting underneath,
			<a class="pagenum" id="page350" title="350"> </a>for communing flesh to flesh with a planet.
			What he feels when he breaks a bit of rock is
			the whole round earth—the wonder of it—the
			great cinder floating through space. He would
			all but risk his life or sell his soul for a bit of
			lava. He is studying the phrenology of a star.
			All the other stars watch him. The feeling
			of being in a kind of eternal, invisible, infinite
			enterprise, of carrying out a world, of tracking
			a God, takes possession of him. He may not
			admit there is a God, in so many words, but
			his geology admits it. He devotes his whole
			life to appreciating a God, and the God takes
			the deed for the word, appreciates his appreciation,
			whether he does or not. If he says that
			he does not believe in a God, he merely means
			that he does not believe in Calvin’s God, or in
			the present dapper, familiar little God or the
			hero of the sermon last Sunday. All he means
			by not believing in a God is that his God has
			not been represented yet. In the meantime
			he and his geology go sternly, implacably on
			for thousands of years, while churches come
			and go. So does his God. His geology is his
			own ineradicable worship. His religion, his
			passion for the all, for communing through the
			part with the Whole, is merely called by the
			name of geology. In so far as a man’s geology
			is real to him, if he is after anything but a degree
			in it, or a thesis or a salary, his geology
			is an infinite passion taking possession of him,
			soul and body, carrying him along with it,
			<a class="pagenum" id="page351" title="351"> </a>sweeping him out with it into the great workroom,
			the flame and the glow of the world-shop
			of God.</p>

			<p>It would not seem necessary to say it if it
			were not so stoutly denied, but living as we do,
			most of us, with a great flock of little scientists
			around us, pecking on the infinite most of
			them, each with his own little private strut, or
			blasphemy, bragging of a world without a
			God, it does seem as if it were going to be the
			great strategic event of the twentieth century,
			for all men, to get the sciences and the humanities
			together once more, if only in our
			own thoughts, to make ourselves believe as we
			must believe, after all, that it is humanity in a
			scientist, and not a kind of professional inhumanity
			in him, which makes him a scientist in
			the great sense—a seer of matter. The great
			scientist is a man who communes with matter,
			not around his human spirit, but through it.</p>

			<p>The small scientist, violating nature inside
			himself to understand it outside himself, misses
			the point.</p>

			<p>At all events if a man who has locked himself
			out of his own soul goes around the world and
			cannot find God’s in it, he does not prove anything.
			The man who finds a God proves quite
			as much. And he has his God besides.</p>

			Topical Point of View</h4>

			<p>If it is true that reading resolves itself sooner
			or later into two elements in the reader’s mind,
			tables of facts and feelings about the facts, that
			is, rows of raw fact, and spiritualised or related
			facts, several things follow. The most important
			of them is one’s definition of education.
			The man who can get the greatest amount of
			feeling out of the smallest number and the
			greatest variety of facts is the greatest and
			most educated man—comes nearest to living an
			infinite life. The purpose of education in
			books would seem to be to make every man as
			near to this great or semi-infinite man as he
			can be made.</p>

			<p>If men were capable of becoming infinite by
			sitting in a library long enough, the education-problem
			would soon take care of itself. There
			is no front or side door to the infinite. It is all
			doors. And if the mere taking time enough
			would do it, one could read one’s way into the
			infinite as easily as if it were anything else.
			One can hardly miss it. One could begin anywhere.
			There would be nothing to do but to
			proceed at once to read all the facts and have
			all the feelings about the facts and enjoy them
			forever. The main difficulty one comes to,
			in being infinite, is that there is not time, but
			inasmuch as great men or semi-infinite men
			<a class="pagenum" id="page353" title="353"> </a>have all had to contend with this same difficulty
			quite as much as the rest of us, it would
			seem that in getting as many of the infinite
			facts, and having as many infinite feelings
			about the facts, as they do, great men must
			employ some principle of economy or selection,
			that common, that is, artificial men, are apt to
			overlook.</p>

			<p>There seem to be two main principles of
			economy open to great men and to all of us, in
			the acquiring of knowledge. One of these, as
			has been suggested, may be called the scientist’s
			principle of economy, and the other the
			poet’s or artist’s. The main difference between
			the scientific and the artistic method of
			selection seems to be that the scientist does his
			selecting all at once and when he selects his
			career, and the artist makes selecting the entire
			business of every moment of his life. The
			scientist of the average sort begins by partitioning
			the universe off into topics. Having selected
			his topic and walled himself in with it,
			he develops it by walling the rest of the universe
			out. The poet (who is almost always a
			specialist also, a special kind of poet), having
			selected his specialty, develops it by letting all
			the universe in. He spends his time in making
			his life a cross section of the universe. The
			spirit of the whole of it, something of everything
			in it, is represented in everything he does.
			Whatever his specialty may be in poetry,
			painting, or literature, he produces an eternal
			<a class="pagenum" id="page354" title="354"> </a>result by massing the infinite and eternal into
			the result. He succeeds by bringing the universe
			to a point, by accumulating out of all
			things—himself. It is the tendency of the
			scientist to produce results by dividing the
			universe and by subdividing himself. Unless
			he is a very great scientist he accepts it as the
			logic of his method that he should do this.
			His individual results are small results and he
			makes himself professedly small to get them.</p>

			<p>All questions with regard to the reading
			habit narrow themselves down at last: “Is
			the Book to be divided for the Man, or is the
			Man to be divided for the Book? Shall a man
			so read as to lose his soul in a subject, or shall
			he so read that the subject Loses itself in him—becomes
			a part of him?” The main fact about
			our present education is that it is the man
			who is getting lost. And not only is every
			man getting lost to himself, but all men are
			eagerly engaged in getting lost to each other.
			The dead level of intelligence, being a dead
			level in a literal sense, is a spiritless level—a
			mere grading down and grading up of appearances.
			In all that pertains to real knowledge
			of the things that people appear to know,
			greater heights and depths of difference in
			human lives are revealed to-day than in almost
			any age of the world. What with our steam-engines
			(machines for our hands and feet) and
			our sciences (machines for our souls) we have
			arrived at such an extraordinary division of
			<a class="pagenum" id="page355" title="355"> </a>labour, both of body and mind, that people of
			the same classes are farther apart than they
			used to be in different classes. Lawyers, for
			instance, are as different from one another as
			they used to be from ministers and doctors.
			Every new skill we come to and every new
			subdivision of skill marks the world off into
			pigeon-holes of existence, into huge, hopeless,
			separate divisions of humanity. We live in
			different elements, monsters of the sea wondering
			at the air, air-monsters peering curiously
			down into the sea, sailors on surfaces, trollers
			over other people’s worlds. We commune
			with each other with lines and hooks. Some
			of us on the rim of the earth spend all our days
			quarrelling over bits of the crust of it. Some
			of us burrow and live in the ground, and are
			as workers in mines. The sound of our voices
			to one another is as though they were not.
			They are as the sound of picks groping in
			rocks.</p>

			<p>The reason that we are not able to produce
			or even to read a great literature is that a
			great book can never be written, in spirit at
			least, except to a whole human race. The
			final question with regard to every book that
			comes to a publisher to-day is what mine shall
			it be written in, which public shall it burrow
			for? A book that belongs to a whole human
			race, which cannot be classified or damned
			into smallness, would only be left by itself on
			the top of the ground in the sunlight. The
			<a class="pagenum" id="page356" title="356"> </a>next great book that comes will have to take a
			long trip, a kind of drummer’s route around
			life, from mind to mind, and now in one
			place and now another be let down through
			shafts to us. There is no whole human race.
			A book with even forty-man power in it goes
			begging for readers. The reader with more
			than one-, two-, or three-man power of reading
			scarcely exists. We shall know our great
			book when it comes by the fact that crowds of
			kinds of men will flock to the paragraphs in it,
			each kind to its own kind of paragraph. It
			will hardly be said to reach us, the book with
			forty-man power in it, until it has been broken
			up into fortieths of itself. When it has been
			written over again—broken off into forty books
			by forty men, none of them on speaking terms
			with each other—it shall be recognised in some
			dim way that it must have been a great book.</p>

			<p>It is the first law of culture, in the highest
			sense, that it always begins and ends with the
			fact that a man is a man. Teaching the fact
			to a man that he can be a greater man is the
			shortest and most practical way of teaching
			him other facts. It is only by being a greater
			man, by raising his state of being to the <i>n</i><sup>th</sup>
			power, that he can be made to see the other
			facts. The main attribute of the education of
			the future, in so far as it obtains to-day, is that
			it strikes both ways. It strikes in and makes
			a man mean something, and having made the
			man—the main fact—mean something, it
			<a class="pagenum" id="page357" title="357"> </a>strikes out through the man and makes all
			other facts mean something. It makes new
			facts, and old facts as good as new. It makes
			new worlds. All attempts to make a whole
			world without a single whole man anywhere to
			begin one out of are vain attempts. We are
			going to have great men again some time, but
			the science that attempts to build a civilisation
			in this twentieth century by subdividing such
			men as we already have mocks at itself. The
			devil is not a specialist and never will be. He
			is merely getting everybody else to be, as fast
			as he can.</p>

			<p>It is safe to say in this present hour of subdivided
			men and sub-selected careers that any
			young man who shall deliberately set out at
			the beginning of his life to be interested, at
			any expense and at all hazards, in everything,
			in twenty or thirty years will have the field
			entirely to himself. It is true that he will
			have to run, what every more vital man has
			had to run, the supreme risk, the risk of being
			either a fool or a seer, a fool if he scatters himself
			into everything, a seer if he masses everything
			into himself. But when he succeeds at
			last he will find that for all practical purposes,
			as things are going to-day, he will have a
			monopoly of the universe, of the greatest force
			there is in it, the combining and melting and
			fusing force that brings all men and all ideas
			together, making the race one—a force which
			is the chief characteristic of every great period
			<a class="pagenum" id="page358" title="358"> </a>and of every great character that history has
			known.</p>

			<p>It is obvious that whatever may be its
			dangers, the topical or scientific point of view
			in knowledge is one that the human race is not
			going to get along without, if it is to be master
			of the House it lives in. It is also obvious
			that the human or artistic, the man-point of
			view in knowledge is one that it is not going
			to get along without, if the House is to continue
			to have Men in it.</p>

			<p>The question remains, the topical point of
			view and the artistic point of view both being
			necessary, how shall a man contrive in the
			present crowding of the world to read with
			both? Is there any principle in reading that
			fuses them both? And if there is, what is it?</p>

			Focusing</h4>

			<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">There</span> are only a few square inches—of
			cells and things, no one quite knows
			what—on a human face, but a man can see
			more of the world in those few inches, and
			understand more of the meaning of the world
			in them, put the world together better there,
			than in any other few inches that God has
			made. Even one or two faces do it, for a
			man, for most of us, when we have seen them
			through and through. Not a face anywhere—no
			one has ever seen one that was not a
			mirror of a whole world, a poor and twisted one
			perhaps, but a great one. The man that goes
			with it may not know it, may not have much
			<a class="pagenum" id="page360" title="360"> </a>to do with it. While he is waiting to die, God
			writes on him; but however it is, every man’s
			face (I cannot help feeling it when I really look
			at it) is helplessly great. It is one man’s portrait
			of the universe as he has found it—his
			portrait of a Whole. I have caught myself
			looking at crowds of faces as if they were rows
			of worlds. Is not everything I can know or
			guess or cry or sing written on faces? An
			audience is a kind of universe by itself. I
			could pray to one—when once the soul is
			hushed before it. If there were any necessity
			to select one place rather than another, any
			particular place to address a God in, I think I
			would choose an audience. Praying for it instead
			of to it is a mere matter of form. I cannot
			find a face in it that does not lead to a God,
			that does not gather a God in for me out of all
			space, that is not one of His assembling places.
			Many and many a time when heads were being
			bowed have I caught a face in a congregation
			and prayed to it and with it. Every man’s face
			is a kind of prayer he carries around with him.
			One can hardly help joining in it. It is
			sacrament to look at his face, if only to take
			sides in it, join with the God-self in it and
			help against the others. Whoever or Whatever
			He is, up there across all heaven, He is a
			God to me because He can be infinitely small
			or infinitely great as He likes. I will not have
			a God that can be shut up into any horizon or
			shut out of any face. When I have stood before
			<a class="pagenum" id="page361" title="361"> </a>audiences, have really realised faces, felt
			the still and awful thronging of them through
			my soul, it has seemed to me as if some great
			miracle were happening. It’s as if—but who
			shall say it?—Have you never stood, Gentle
			Reader, alone at night on the frail rim of the
			earth—spread your heart out wide upon the
			dark, and let it lie there,—let it be flocked on
			by stars? It is like that when Something is
			lifted and one sees faces. Faces are worlds to
			me. However hard I try, I cannot get a man,
			somehow, any smaller than a world. He is a
			world to himself, and God helping me, when I
			deal with him, he shall be a world to me. The
			dignity of a world rests upon him. His face
			is a sum-total of the universe. It is made by
			the passing of the infinite through his body.
			It is the mark of all things that are, upon his
			flesh.</p>

			<p>What I like to believe is, that if there is an
			organic principle of unity like this in a little
			human life, if there is some way of summing
			up a universe in a man’s face, there must be
			some way of summing it up, of putting it together
			in his education. It is this summing a
			universe up for one’s self, and putting it together
			for one’s self, and for one’s own use,
			which makes an education in a universe worth
			while.</p>

			<p>In other words, with a symbol as convenient,
			as near to him as his own face, a man need not
			go far in seeking for a principle of unity in
			<a class="pagenum" id="page362" title="362"> </a>focusing education. A man’s face makes it seem not
			unreasonable to claim that the principle of
			unity in all education is the man, that the
			single human soul is created to be its own
			dome of all knowledge. A man’s education
			may be said to be properly laid out in proportion
			as it is laid out the way he lays out his
			countenance. The method or process by which
			a man’s countenance is laid out is a kind of
			daily organic process of world-swallowing.
			What a man undertakes in living is the making
			over of all phenomena, outer sights and
			sounds into his own inner ones, the passing of
			all outside knowledge through himself. In
			proportion as he is being educated he is making
			all things that are, into his own flesh and
			spirit.</p>

			<p>When one looks at it in this way it is not
			too much to say that every man is a world.
			He makes the tiny platform of his soul in infinite
			space, a stage for worlds to come to, to

			<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

			<p class="post_thoughtbreak">It seemed that I stood and watched a world
			awake, the great night still upbearing me
			above the flood of the day. I watched it
			strangely, as a changed being, the godlikeness
			and the might of sleep, the spell of the
			All upon me. I became as one who saw the
			earth as it is, in a high noon of its real self.
			<a class="pagenum" id="page363" title="363"> </a>Hung in its mist of worlds, wrapped in its own
			breath, I saw it—a queer little ball of cooled-off
			fire, it seemed, still and swift plunging
			through space. And when I looked close in
			my heart, I saw cunning little men on it, nations
			and things running around on it. And
			when I looked still nearer, looked at the
			lighted side of it, I saw that each little man
			was not what I thought—a dot or fleck on
			the universe. And I saw that he was a reflection,
			a serious, wondrous miniature of all the
			rest. It all seemed strange to me at first—to
			a man who lives, as I do, in a rather weary,
			laborious, painstaking age—that this should
			be so. As I looked at the little man I wondered
			if it really could be so. Then, as I
			looked, the great light flowed all around the
			little man, and the little man reflected the
			great light.</p>

			<p>But he did not seem to know it.</p>

			<p>I felt like calling out to him—to one of them—telling
			him out loud to himself, wrapped
			away as he was, in his haste and dumbness,
			not knowing, and in the funny little noise of
			cities in the great still light. And so while
			the godlikeness and the might of sleep was
			upon me, I watched him, longed for him,
			wanted him for myself. I thought of my great
			cold, stretched-out wisdom. How empty and
			bare it was, this staring at stars one by one,
			this taking notes on creation, this slow painful
			tour of space, when after all right down there
			<a class="pagenum" id="page364" title="364"> </a>in this little man, I said “Is not all I can know,
			or hope to know stowed away and written
			up?” And when I thought of this—the blur of
			sleep still upon me—I could hardly help reaching
			down for him, half-patronising him, half-worshipping
			him, taking him up to myself,
			where I could keep him by me, keep him to
			consult, watch for the sun, face for the infinite.—“Dear
			little fellow!” I said, “my own
			queer little fellow! my own little Kosmos,
			pocket-size!”</p>

			<p>I thought how convenient it would be if I
			could take one in my hand, do my seeing
			through it, focus my universe with it. And
			when the strange mood left me and I came to,
			I remembered or thought I remembered that I
			was one of Those myself. “Why not be your
			own little Kosmos-glass?” I said.</p>

			<p>I have been trying it now for some time. It
			is hard to regulate the focus of course, and it
			is not always what it ought to be. It has to
			be allowed for some. I do not claim much for
			it. But it’s better, such as it is, than a sheer
			bit of Nothing, I think, to look at a universe
			with.</p>

			The Human Unit</h4>

			<p>It matters little that the worlds that are
			made in this way are very different in detail or
			emphasis, that some of them are much smaller
			<a class="pagenum" id="page365" title="365"> </a>and more twisted than others. The great
			point, so far as education is concerned, is for
			all teachers to realise that every man is a
			whole world, that it is possible and natural for
			every man to be a whole world. His very body
			is, and there must be some way for him to have
			a whole world in his mind. A being who finds
			a way of living a world into his face can find a
			way of reading a world together. If a man is
			going to have unity, read his world together,
			possess all-in-oneness in knowledge, he will
			have to have it the way he has it in his face.</p>

			<p>It is superficial to assume, as scientists are
			apt to do, that in a world where there are infinite
			things to know, a man’s knowledge must
			have unity or can have unity, in and of itself.
			The moment that all the different knowledges
			of a man are passed over or allowed to be passed
			over into his personal qualities, into the muscles
			and traits and organs and natural expressions
			of the man, they have unity and force and order
			and meaning as a matter of course. Infinite
			opposites of knowledge, recluses and separates
			of knowledge are gathered and can be seen
			gathered every day in almost any man, in the
			glance of his eye, in the turn of his lip, or in
			the blow of his fist.</p>

			<p>It is not the method of science as science,
			and it is not in any sense put forward as the
			proper method for a man to use in his mere
			specialty, but it does seem to be true that if a
			man wants to know things which he does not
			<a class="pagenum" id="page366" title="366"> </a>intend to know all of, the best and most scientific
			way for him to know such things is to
			reach out to them and know them through
			their human or personal relations. I can only
			speak for myself, but I have found for one that
			the easiest and most thorough, practical way
			for me to get the benefit of things I do not
			know, is to know a man who does. If he is
			an educated man, a man who really knows,
			who has made what he knows over into himself,
			I find if I know him that I get it all—the gist
			of it. The spirit of his knowledge, its attitude
			toward life, is all in the man, and if I really
			know the man, absorb his nature, drink deep
			at his soul, I know what he knows—it seems
			to me—and what I know besides. It is true
			that I cannot express it precisely. He would
			have to give the lecture or diagram of it, but I
			know it—know what it comes to in life, his life
			and my life. I can be seen going around living
			with it afterwards, any day. His knowledge
			is summed up in him, his whole world is read
			together in him, belongs to him, and he belongs
			to me. To know a man is to know what he
			knows in its best form—the things that have
			made the man possible.</p>

			<p>A great portrait painter, it has always seemed
			to me, is a kind of god in his way—knows
			everything his sitters know. He knows what
			every man’s knowledge has done with the man—the
			best part of it—and makes it speak. I
			have never yet found myself looking at great
			<a class="pagenum" id="page367" title="367"> </a>walls of faces (one painter’s faces), found myself
			walking up and down in Sargent’s soul,
			without thinking what a great inhabited,
			trooped-through man he was—all knowledges
			flocking to him, showing their faces to him,
			from the ends of the earth, emptying their
			secrets silently out to his brush. If a man like
			Sargent has for one of his sitters a great astronomer,
			an astronomer who is really great,
			who knows and absorbs stars, Sargent absorbs
			the man, and as a last result the stars in the
			man, and the man in Sargent, and the man’s
			stars in Sargent, all look out of the canvas.</p>

			<p>It is the spirit that sums up and unifies
			knowledge. It is a fact to be reckoned with,
			in education, that knowledge can be summed
			up, and that the best summing up of it is a
			human face.</p>

			The Higher Cannibalism</h4>

			<p>It is not unnatural to claim, therefore, that
			the most immediate and important short-cut in
			knowledge that the comprehensive or educated
			man can take comes to him through his human
			and personal relations. There is no better way
			of getting at the spirits of facts, of tracing out
			valuable and practical laws or generalisations,
			than the habit of trying things on to people in
			one’s mind.</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page368" title="368"> </a>I have always thought that if I ever got discouraged
			and had to be an editor, I would do
			this more practically. As it is, I merely do it
			with books. I find no more satisfactory way
			of reading most books—the way one has to—through
			their backs, than reading the few
			books that one does read, through persons and
			for persons and with persons. It is a great
			waste of time to read a book alone. One needs
			room for rows of one’s friends in a book. One
			book read through the eyes of ten people has
			more reading matter in it than ten books read
			in a common, lazy, lonesome fashion. One
			likes to do it, not only because one finds one’s
			self enjoying a book ten times over, getting ten
			people’s worth out of it, but because it makes
			a kind of sitting-room of one’s mind, puts a
			fire-place in it, and one watches the ten people
			enjoying one another.</p>

			<p>It may be for better and it may be for
			worse, but I have come to the point where, if I
			really care about a book, the last thing I want
			to do with it is to sit down in a chair and read
			it by myself. If I were ever to get so low in
			my mind as to try to give advice to a real live
			author (any author but a dead one), it would
			be, “Let there be room for all of us, O Author,
			in your book. If I am to read a live, happy,
			human book, give me a bench.”</p>

			<p>I have noticed that getting at truth on most
			subjects is a dramatic process rather than an
			argumentative one. One gets at truth either
			<a class="pagenum" id="page369" title="369"> </a>in a book or in a conversation not so much by
			logic as by having different people speak. If
			what is wanted is a really comprehensive view
			of a subject, two or three rather different men
			placed in a row and talking about it, saying
			what they think about it in a perfectly plain
			way, without argument, will do more for it
			than two or three hundred syllogisms. A man
			seems to be the natural or wild form of the
			syllogism, which this world has tacitly agreed
			to adopt. Even when he is a very poor one he
			works better with most people than the other
			kind. If a man takes a few other men (very
			different ones), uses them as glasses to see a
			truth through, it will make him as wise in a
			few minutes, with that truth, as a whole human
			race.</p>

			<p>Knowledge which comes to a man with any
			particular sweep or scope is, in the very nature
			of things, dramatic.</p>

			<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

			<p class="post_thoughtbreak">[I fear, Gentle Reader, I am nearing a conviction.
			I feel a certain constraint coming
			over me. I always do, when I am nearing
			a conviction. I never can be sure how my
			soul will take it upon itself to act when I am
			making the attempt I am making now, to state
			what is to me an intensely personal belief, in a
			general, convincing, or impersonal way. The
			embarrassing part of a conviction is that it is
			so. And when a man attempts to state a
			thing as it is, to speak for God or everybody,—well,
			<a class="pagenum" id="page370" title="370"> </a>it would not be respectable not to be
			embarrassed a little—speaking for God. I
			know perfectly well, sitting here at my desk,
			this minute, with this conviction up in my
			pen, that it is merely a little thing of my own,
			that I ought to go on from this point cool and
			straight with it. But it is a conviction, and if
			you find me, Gentle Reader, in the very next
			page, swivelling off and speaking for God, I can
			only beg that both He and you will forgive me.
			I solemnly assure you herewith, that, however
			it may look, I am merely speaking for myself.
			I have thought of having a rubber stamp for
			this book, a stamp with <span class="small_all_caps">IT SEEMS TO ME</span> on it.
			A good many of these pages need going over
			with it afterwards. I do not suppose there is
			a man living—either I or any other dogmatist—who
			would not enjoy more speaking for himself
			(if anybody would notice it) than speaking for
			God. I have a hope that if I can only hold
			myself to it on this subject I shall do much
			better in speaking for myself, and may speak
			accidentally for God besides. I leave it for
			others to say, but it is hard not to point a little—in
			a few places.]</p>

			<p>But here is the conviction. As I was going
			to say, knowledge which comes to a man with
			any particular sweep or scope is in the very
			nature of things dramatic. If the minds of
			two men expressing opinions in the dark could
			be flashed on a canvas, if there could be such
			a thing as a composite photograph of an opinion—a
			<a class="pagenum" id="page371" title="371"> </a>biograph of it,—it would prove to be, with
			nine men out of ten, a dissolving view of faces.
			The unspoken sides of thought are all dramatic.
			The palest generalisation a man can express,
			if it could be first stretched out into its origins,
			and then in its origins could be crowded up
			and focused, would be found to be a long unconscious
			procession of human beings—a murmur
			of countless voices. All our knowledge
			is conceived at first, taken up and organised in
			actual men, flashed through the delights of
			souls and the music of voices upon our brains.
			If it is true even in the business of the street
			that the greatest efficiency is reached by dealers
			who mix with the knowledge of their subject
			a keen appreciation and mastery of men, it is
			still more true of the business of the mind that
			the greatest, most natural and comprehensive
			results are reached through the dramatic or
			human insights.</p>

			<p>All our knowledge is dead drama. Wisdom
			is always some old play faded out, blurred
			into abstractions. A principle is a wonderful
			disguised biograph. The power of Carlyle’s
			<cite>French Revolution</cite> is that it is a great spiritual
			play, a series of pictures and faces.</p>

			<p>It was the French Revolution all happening
			over again to Carlyle, and it was another
			French Revolution to every one of his readers.
			It was dynamic, an induced current from Paris
			via Craigenputtock, because it was dramatic—great
			abstractions, playing magnificently over
			<a class="pagenum" id="page372" title="372"> </a>great concretes. Every man in Carlyle’s history
			is a philosophy, and every abstraction in
			it a man’s face, a beckoning to us. He always
			seems to me a kind of colossus of a man stalking
			across the dark, way out in The Past, using
			men as search-lights. He could not help doing
			his thinking in persons, and everything he
			touches is terribly and beautifully alive. It
			was because he saw things in persons, that is,
			in great, rapid, organised sum-totals of experience
			and feeling, that he was able to make so
			much of so little as a historian, and what is
			quite as important (at least in history), so little
			of so much.</p>

			<p>The true criticism of Carlyle as a historian
			is not a criticism of his method, that he
			went about in events and eras doing his
			seeing and thinking with persons, but that
			there were certain sorts of persons that Carlyle,
			with his mere lighted-up-brute imagination,
			could never see with. They were opaque
			to him. Every time he lifted one of them up
			to see ten years with, or a bevy of events or
			whatever it might be, he merely made blots or
			sputters with them, on his page. But it was
			his method that made it a great page, wider
			and deeper and more splendid than any of the
			others, and the blots were always obvious blots,
			did no harm there—no historical harm—almost
			any one could see them, and if they could not,
			were there not always plenty of little chilled-through
			historians, pattering around after him,
			<a class="pagenum" id="page373" title="373"> </a>tracking them out? But the great point of
			Carlyle’s method was that he kept his perspective
			with it. Never flattened out like
			other historians, by tables of statistics, unbewildered
			by the blur of nobodies, he was able
			to have a live, glorious giant’s way of writing,
			a godlike method of handling great handfuls
			of events in one hand, of unrolling great
			stretches of history with a look, of seeing
			things and making things seen, in huge, broad,
			focussed, vivid human wholes. It was a historical
			method of treating great masses, which
			Thomas Carlyle and Shakespeare and Homer
			and the Old Testament all have in common.</p>

			<p>The fact that it fails in the letter and with
			hordes of literal persons, that it has great gaps
			of temperament left over in it, is of lesser
			weight. The letter passes by (thank Heaven!)
			in the great girths of time and space. In all
			lasting or real history, only the spirit has a
			right to live. Temperaments in histories even
			at the worst are easily allowed for, filled out
			with temperaments of other historians—that is,
			they ought to be and are going to be if we ever
			have real historians any more, historians great
			enough and alive enough to have temperaments,
			and with temperaments great enough
			to write history the way God does—that can be
			read.</p>

			<p>History can only be truly written by men
			who have concepts of history, and “Every
			concept,” says Hegel, “must be universal,
			<a class="pagenum" id="page374" title="374"> </a>concrete, and particular, or else it cannot be
			a concept.” That is, it must be dramatic.</p>

			<p>And what is true of a great natural man or
			man of genius like Carlyle is equally true of
			all other natural persons whether men of genius
			or not. A stenographic report of all the
			thoughts of almost any man’s brain for a day
			would prove to almost any scientist how spiritually
			organised, personally conducted a human
			being’s brain is bound to be, almost in spite
			of itself—even when it has been educated, artificially
			numbed and philosophised. A man
			may not know the look of the inside of his
			mind well enough to formulate or recognise it,
			but nearly every man’s thinking is done, as a
			matter of course, either in people, or to people,
			or for people, or out of people. It is the way
			he grows, the way the world is woven through
			his being, the way of having life more abundantly.</p>

			<p>It is not at all an exaggeration to say that if
			Shakespeare had not created his characters
			they would have created him. One need not
			wonder so very much that Shakespeare grew so
			masterfully in his later plays and as the years
			went on. Such a troop of people as flocked
			through Shakespeare’s soul would have made
			a Shakespeare (allowing more time for it) out
			of almost anybody.</p>

			<p>The essential wonder of Shakespeare, the
			greatness which has made men try to make a
			dozen specialists out of him, is not so very
			<a class="pagenum" id="page375" title="375"> </a>wonderful when one considers that he was a
			dramatist. A dramatist cannot help growing
			great. At least he has the outfit for it if he
			wants to. One hardly wants to be caught giving
			a world recipe,—a prescription for being a
			great man; but it does look sometimes as if the
			habit of reading for persons, of being a sort of
			spiritual cannibal, or man-eater, of going about
			through all the world absorbing personalities
			the way other men absorb facts, would gradually
			store up personality in a man, and make him
			great—almost inconveniently great, at times,
			and in spite of himself. The probabilities seem
			to be that it was because Shakespeare instinctively
			picked out persons in the general scheme
			of knowledge more than facts; it was because
			persons seemed to him, on the whole in every
			age, to be the main facts the age was for, summed
			the most facts up; it was because they made
			him see the most facts, helped him to feel and
			act on facts, made facts experiences to him,
			that William Shakespeare became so supreme
			and masterful with facts and men both.</p>

			<p>To learn how to be <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro tem</em>. all kinds of men,
			about all things, to enjoy their joys in the
			things, is the greatest and the livest way of
			learning the things.</p>

			<p>To learn to be a Committee of the Temperaments
			all by one’s self (which is what Shakespeare
			did) is at once the method and the end
			of education—outside of one’s specialty.</p>

			<p>There could be no better method of doing
			<a class="pagenum" id="page376" title="376"> </a>this (no method open to everybody) than the
			method,—outside of one’s specialty,—of reading
			for persons and with persons. It makes all
			one’s life a series of spiritual revelations. It
			is like having regular habits of being born
			again, of having new experiences at will. It
			mobilises all love and passion and delight in the
			world and sends it flowing past one’s door.</p>

			<p>In this day of immeasurable exercises, why
			does not some one put in a word for the good
			old-fashioned exercise of being born again? It
			is an exercise which few men seem to believe
			in, not even once in a lifetime, but it is easily
			the best all-around drill for living, and even
			for reading, that can be arranged. And it is
			not a very difficult exercise if one knows how,
			does it regularly enough. It is not at all necessary
			to go off to another world to believe in reincarnations,
			if one practises on them every
			day. Women have always seemed to be more
			generally in the way of being born again than
			men, but they have less scope and sometimes
			there is a certain feverish smallness about it,
			and when men once get started (like Robert
			Browning in distinction from Mrs. Browning)
			they make the method of being born again
			seem a great triumphant one. They seem to
			have a larger repertoire to be born to, and
			they go through it more rapidly and justly.
			At the same time it is true that nearly all women
			are more or less familiar with the exercise
			of being born again—living <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro tem</em>. and at
			<a class="pagenum" id="page377" title="377"> </a>will—in others, and only a few men do it—merely
			the greatest ones, statesmen, diplomats,
			editors, poets, great financiers, and other
			prophets—all men who live by seeing more
			than others have time for. They are found to
			do their seeing rather easily on the whole.
			They do it by the perfectly normal exercise of
			being born into other men, looking out of their
			eyes a minute, whenever they like. All great
			power in its first stage is essentially dramatic,
			a man-judging, man-illuminating power, the
			power of guessing what other people are going
			to think and do.</p>

			<p>When the world points out to the young man,
			as it is very fond of doing, that he must learn
			from experience, what it really means is, that
			he must learn from his dramatic drill in human
			life, his contact with real persons, his slow,
			compulsory scrupulous going the rounds of his
			heart, putting himself in the place of real
			persons.</p>

			<p>Probably every man who lives, in proportion
			as he covets power or knowledge, would like to
			be (at will at least) a kind of focused everybody.
			It is true that in his earlier stages, and
			in his lesser moods afterward, he would probably
			seem to most people a somewhat teetering
			person, diffused, chaotic, or contradictory. It
			could hardly be helped—with the raw materials
			of a great man all scattered around in him,
			great unaccounted-for insights, idle-looking
			powers all as yet unfused. But a man in the
			<a class="pagenum" id="page378" title="378"> </a>long run (and longer the better) is always
			worth while, no matter how he looks in the
			making, and it certainly does seem reasonable,
			however bad it may look, that this is the way
			he is made, that in proportion as he does his
			knowing spiritually and powerfully, he will
			have to do it dramatically. It sometimes
			seems as if knowing, in the best sense, were a
			kind of rotary-person process, a being everybody
			in a row, a state of living symposium.
			The interpenetrating, blending-in, digesting
			period comes in due course, the time of settling
			down into himself, and behold the man is
			made, a unified, concentrated, individual, universal
			man—a focused everybody.</p>

			<p>This is not quite being a god perhaps, but it
			is as near to it, on the whole, as a man can
			conveniently get.</p>

			Spiritual Thrift</h4>

			<p>But perhaps one of the most interesting
			things about doing up one’s knowing in persons
			is that it is not only the most alive, but
			the most economical knowledge that can be obtained.
			On the whole, eleven or twelve people
			do very well to know the world with, if one
			can get a complete set, if they are different
			enough, and one knows them down through.
			The rest of the people that one sees about, from
			<a class="pagenum" id="page379" title="379"> </a>the point of view of stretching one’s comprehension,
			one’s essential sympathy or knowledge,
			do not count very much. They are
			duplicates—to be respected and to be loved, of
			course, but to be kept in the cellar of actual
			consciousness. There is no other way to do.
			Everybody was not intended to be used by
			everybody. It is because we think that they
			were, mostly, that we have come to our present,
			modern, heartlessly-cordial fashion of knowing
			people—knowing people by parlourfuls—whole
			parlourfuls at a time. “Is thy servant a
			whale?” said my not unsociable soul to me.
			“Is one to be fed with one’s kind as if they
			were animalculæ, as if they had to be taken in
			the bulk if one were really to get something?”
			It is heartless and shallow enough. Who is
			not weary of it? No one knows anybody nowadays.
			He merely knows everybody. He
			falls before The Reception Room. A reception
			room is a place where we set people up in rows
			like pickets on a fence to know them. Then
			like the small boy with a stick, one tap per
			picket, we run along knowing people. No one
			comes in touch with any one. It is getting so
			that there is hardly any possible way left in
			our modern life for knowing people except
			by marrying them. One cannot even be sure
			of that, when one thinks how married people
			are being driven about by books and by other
			people. Society is a crowd of crowds mutually
			destroying each other and literature is a crowd
			<a class="pagenum" id="page380" title="380"> </a>of books all shutting each other up, and the
			law seems to be either selection or annihilation,
			whether in reading or living. The only way
			to love everybody in this world seems to be to
			pick out a few in it, delegates of everybody,
			and use these few to read with, and to love and
			understand the world with, and to keep close
			to it, all one’s days.</p>

			<p>The higher form one’s facts are put in in this
			world the fewer one needs. To know twelve
			extremely different souls utterly, to be able to
			borrow them at will, turn them on all knowledge,
			bring them to bear at a moment’s notice
			on anything one likes, is to be an educated,
			masterful man in the most literal possible sense.
			Except in mere matters of physical fact, things
			which are small enough to be put in encyclopedias
			and looked up there, a man with twelve
			deeply loved or deeply pitied souls woven into
			the texture of his being can flash down into
			almost any knowledge that he needs, or go out
			around almost any ignorance that is in his way,
			through all the earth. The shortest way for
			an immortal soul to read a book is to know
			and absorb enough other immortal souls, and
			get them to help. Any system of education
			which like our present prevailing one is so
			vulgar, so unpsychological, as to overlook the
			soul as the organ and method of knowledge,
			which fails to see that the knowledge of human
			souls is itself the method of acquiring all other
			knowledge and of combining and utilising it,
			<a class="pagenum" id="page381" title="381"> </a>makes narrow and trivial and impotent scholars
			as a matter of course.</p>

			<p>Knowledge of human nature and of one’s
			self is the nervous system of knowledge, the
			flash and culmination, the final thoroughness
			of all the knowledge that is worth knowing
			and of all ways of knowing it.</p>

			<p>It is all a theory, I suppose. I cannot prove
			anything with it. I dare say it is true that
			neither I nor any one else can get, by reading in
			this way, what I like to think I am getting,
			slowly, a cross-section of the universe. But it
			is something to get as time goes on a cross-section
			of all the human life that is being lived in
			it. It is something to take each knowledge that
			comes, strike all the keys of one’s friends on it—clear
			the keyboard of space on it. When one
			really does this, nothing can happen to one
			which does not or cannot happen to one in the
			way one likes. Events and topics in this world
			are determined to a large degree by circumstances—dandelions,
			stars, politics, bob-whites,
			acids, Kant, and domestic science—but personalities,
			a man’s means of seeing things, are determined
			only by the limits of his imagination.
			One’s knowledge of pictures, or of Kant, of bob-whites
			or acids, cannot be applied to every conceivable
			occasion, but nothing can happen in
			all the world that one cannot see or feel or delight
			in, or suffer in, through Charles Lamb’s
			soul if one has really acquired it. One can be a
			Charles Lamb almost anywhere toward almost
			<a class="pagenum" id="page382" title="382"> </a>anything that happens along, or a Robert
			Burns or a Socrates or a Heine, or an Amiel
			or a Dickens or Hugo or any one, or one can
			hush one’s soul one eternal moment and be the
			Son of God. To know a few men, to turn them
			into one’s books, to turn them into one another,
			into one’s self, to study history with their
			hearts, to know all men that live with them,
			to put them all together and guess at God with
			them—it seems to me that knowledge that is
			as convenient and penetrating, as easily turned
			on and off, as much like a light as this, is well
			worth having. It would be like taking away
			a whole world, if it were taken away from me—the
			little row of people I do my reading with.
			And some of them are supposed to be dead—hundreds
			of years.</p>

			<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

			<p class="post_thoughtbreak">But the dramatic principle in education
			strikes both ways. While it is true that one
			does not need a very large outfit of people to
			do one’s knowing with, if one has the habit of
			thinking in persons, it is still more true that
			one does not need a large outfit of books.</p>

			<p>As I sit in my library facing the fire I fancy
			I hear, sometimes, my books eating each other
			up. One by one through the years they have
			disappeared from me—only portraits or titles
			are left. The more beautiful book absorbs the
			less and the greater folds itself around the
			small. I seldom take down a book that was an
			enthusiasm once without discovering that the
			<a class="pagenum" id="page383" title="383"> </a>heart of it has fled away, has stealthily moved
			over, while I dreamed, to some other book.
			Lowell and Whittier are footnotes scattered
			about in several volumes, now. J. G. Holland
			(Sainte-Beuve of my youth!) is digested by Matthew
			Arnold and Matthew Arnold by Walter
			Pater and Walter Pater by Walt Whitman.
			Montaigne and Plato have moved over into
			Emerson, and Emerson has been distilled slowly
			into—forty years. Holmes has dissolved into
			Charles Lamb and Thomas Browne. A big
			volume of Rossetti (whom I oddly knew first)
			is lost in a little volume of Keats, and as I sit
			and wait Ruskin and Carlyle are going fast
			into a battered copy on my desk—of the Old
			Testament. Once let the dramatic principle
			get well started in a man’s knowledge and it
			seems to keep on sending him up new currents
			the way his heart does, whether he notices it
			or not. If a man will leave his books and his
			people to themselves, if he will let them do
			with him and with one another what they want
			to do, they all work while he sleeps. If the
			spirit of knowledge, the dramatic principle in
			it, is left free, knowledge all but comes to a
			man of itself, cannot help coming, like the
			dew on the grass. With enough reading for
			persons one need not buy very many books.
			One allows for unconscious cerebration in
			books. Books not only have a way of being
			read through their backs, but of reading one
			another.</p>

			The City, the Church, and the College</h4>

			<p>The greatest event of the nineteenth century
			was that somewhere in it, at some immense
			and hidden moment in it, human knowledge
			passed silently over from the emphasis of Persons
			to the emphasis of Things.</p>

			<p>I have walked up and down Broadway when
			the whole street was like a prayer to me—miles
			of it—a long dull cry to its little strip of
			heaven. I have been on the Elevated—the
			huge shuttle of the great city—hour by hour,
			had my soul woven into New York on it, back
			and forth, up and down, until it was hardly a
			soul at all, a mere ganglion, a quivering,
			pressed-in nerve of second-story windows, skies
			of clotheslines, pale faces, mist and rumble
			and dust. “Perhaps I have a soul,” I say.
			“Perhaps I have not. Has any one a soul?”
			When I look at the men I say to myself, “Now
			I will look at the women,” and when I look at
			the women I say, “Now I will look at the
			men.” Then I look at shoes. Men are cheap
			in New York. Every little man I see stewing
			along the street, when I look into his face in
			my long, slow country way, as if a hill belonged
			with him or a scrap of sky or something, or as if
			he really counted, looks at me as one would say,
			“I? I am a millionth of New York—and you?”</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page385" title="385"> </a>I am not even that. The city gathers itself
			together in a great roar about me, puts its
			hands to its mouth and bellows in my country
			ears, “Men are cheap enough, dear boy,
			didn’t you know that? See those dots on
			Brooklyn Bridge?”</p>

			<p>I go on with my walk. I stop and look up
			at the great blocks. “Who are you?” the
			great blocks say. I take another step. I am
			one more shuffle on the street. “Men are
			cheap. Look at <em>us</em>—” a thousand show windows
			say. Are there not square miles of
			human countenance drifting up Broadway
			any day? “And where are they going?” I
			asked my soul. “To oblivion?”—“They are
			going from Things,” said my soul, “to
			Things”; and <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">sotto voce</em>, “From one set of
			Things they know they do not want, to another
			set of Things they do not know they do
			not want.”</p>

			<p>One need not wonder very long that nearly
			every man one knows in New York is at best
			a mere cheered-up and plucky pessimist. Of
			course one has to go down and see one’s
			favourite New Yorker, one needs to and wants
			to, and one needs to get wrought in with him
			too, but when one gets home, who is there who
			does not have to get free from his favourite
			New Yorker, shake himself off from him, save
			his soul a little longer? “Men are cheap,”
			it keeps saying over and over to one,—a
			New York soul does. It keeps coming back—whispering
			<a class="pagenum" id="page386" title="386"> </a>through all the aisles of thought.
			New York spreads itself like a vast concrete philosophy
			over every man’s spirit. It reeks with
			cheapness, human cheapness. How could it
			be otherwise with a New York man? I never
			come home from New York, wander through
			the city with my heart, afterward, look down
			upon it, see Broadway with this little man on
			it, fretting up and down between his twenty-story
			blocks, in his little trough of din under
			the wide heaven, loomed at by iron and glass,
			browbeaten by stone, smothered by smoke, but
			that he all but seems to me, this little Broadway
			man, to be slipping off the planet, to
			barely belong to the planet. I feel like clutching
			at him, helping him to hold on, pitying
			him. Then I remember how it really is (if
			there is any pitying to be done),—this crowded-over,
			crowded-off, matter-cringing, callous-looking
			man, pities me.</p>

			<p>When I was coming home from New York
			the last time, had reached a safe distance behind
			my engine, out in the fields, I found myself
			listening all over again to the roar (saved
			up in me) of the great city. I tried to make
			it out, tried to analyse what it was that the
			voice of the great city said to me. “The voice
			of the city is the Voice of Things,” my soul
			said to me. “And the Man?” I said, “where
			does the Man come in? Are not the Things
			for the Man?” Then the roar of the great
			city rose up about me, like a flood, swallowed
			<a class="pagenum" id="page387" title="387"> </a>my senses in itself, numbed and overbore me,
			swooned my soul in itself, and said: “<strong class="special_emphasis">No,
			the things are not for the man. The
			man is for the things.</strong>”</p>

			<p>This is what the great city said. And while
			I still listened, the roar broke over me once
			more with its <span class="small_all_caps">NO! NO! NO!</span> its million voices
			in it, its million souls in it. All doubts and
			fears and hates and cries, all deadnesses flowed
			around me, took possession of me.</p>

			<p>Then I remembered the iron and wood faces
			of the men, great processions of them, I had
			seen there, the strange, protected-looking,
			boxed-in faces of the women, faces in crates,
			I had seen, and I understood. “New York,”
			I said, “is a huge war, a great battle numbered
			off in streets and houses, every man against
			every man, every man a shut-in, self-defended
			man. It is a huge lamp-lighted, sun-lighted,
			ceaseless struggle, day unto day.”</p>

			<p>“But New York is not the world. Try the
			whole world,” said my soul to me. “Perhaps
			you can do better. Are there not churches,
			men-making, men-gathering places, oases for
			strength and rest in it?”</p>

			<p>Then I went to all the churches in the land
			at once, of a still Sabbath morning, steeples in
			the fields and hills, and steeples in cities. The
			sound of splendid organs praying for the poor
			emptied people, the long, still, innumerable
			sound of countless collections being taken,
			the drone and seesaw of sermons, countless
			<a class="pagenum" id="page388" title="388"> </a>sermons! (Ah, these poor helpless Sundays!)
			Paper-philosophy and axioms. Chimes of
			bells to call the people to paper-philosophy and
			axioms! “Canst thou not,” said I to my soul,
			“guide me to a Man, to a door that leads to a
			Man—a world-lover or prophet?” Then I fled
			(I always do after a course of churches) to the
			hills from whence cometh strength. David
			tried to believe this. I do sometimes, but
			hills are great, still, coldly companionable,
			rather heartless fellows. I know in my heart
			that all the hills on earth, with all their halos
			on them, their cities of leaves, and circles of
			life, would not take the place to me, in mystery,
			closeness, illimitableness, and wonder—of one
			man.</p>

			<p>And when I turn from the world of affairs
			and churches, to the world of scholarship, I
			cannot say that I find relief. Even scholarship,
			scholarship itself, is under a stone most
			of it, prone and pale and like all the rest, under
			The Emphasis of Things. Scholarship is getting
			to be a mere huge New York, infinite
			rows and streets of things, taught by rows of
			men who have made themselves over into
			things, to another row of men who are trying
			to make themselves over into things. I visit
			one after the other of our great colleges, with
			their forlorn, lonesome little chapels, cosy-corners
			for God and for the humanities, their
			vast Thing-libraries, men like dots in them,
			their great long, reached-out laboratories, stables
			<a class="pagenum" id="page389" title="389"> </a>for truth, and I am obliged to confess in spirit
			that even the colleges, in all ages the strongholds
			of the human past, and the human future,
			the citadels of manhood, are getting to be great
			man-blind centres, shambles of souls, places
			for turning every man out from himself, every
			man away from other men, making a Thing of
			him—or at best a Columbus for a new kind of fly,
			or valet to a worm, or tag or label on Matter.</p>

			<p>When one considers that it is a literal, scientific,
			demonstrable fact that there is not a single
			evil that can be named in modern life, social,
			religious, political, or industrial, which is not
			based on the narrowness and blindness of
			classes of men toward one another, it is very
			hard to sit by and watch the modern college almost
			everywhere, with its silent, deadly Thing-emphasis
			upon it, educating every man it can
			reach, into not knowing other men, into not
			knowing even himself.</p>

			The Outsiders</h4>

			<p>One cannot but look with deep pleasure at
			first, and with much relief, upon these healthy
			objective modern men of ours. The only way
			out, for spiritual hardihood, after the world-sick
			Middle Ages, was a Columbus, a vast splendid
			train of Things after him, of men who emphasised
			Things,—who could emphasise Things.
			<a class="pagenum" id="page390" title="390"> </a>It is a great spectacle and a memorable one—the
			one we are in to-day, the spectacle of the
			wonder that men are doing with Things, but
			when one begins to see that it is all being
			turned around, that it is really a spectacle of
			what Things are doing with men, one wakes
			with a start. One wonders if there could be
			such a thing as having all the personalities of
			a whole generation lost. One looks suspiciously
			and wistfully at the children one sees
			in the schools. One wonders if they are going
			to be allowed, like their fathers and mothers,
			to have personalities to lose. I have all but
			caught myself kidnapping children as I have
			watched them flocking in the street. I have
			wanted to scurry them off to the country, a
			few of them, almost anywhere—for a few
			years. I have thought I would try to find a
			college to hide them in, some back-county,
			protected college, a college which still has the
			emphasis of Persons as well as the emphasis of
			Things upon it. Then I would wait and see
			what would come of it. I would at least have
			a little bevy of great men perhaps, saved out
			for a generation, enough to keep the world
			supplied with samples—to keep up the bare
			idea of the great man, a kind of isthmus to the
			future.</p>

			<p>The test of civilisation is what it produces—its
			man, if only because he produces all else.
			If we have all made up our minds to allow the
			specialist to set the pace for us, either to be
			<a class="pagenum" id="page391" title="391"> </a>specialists ourselves or vulgarly to compete
			with specialists, for the right of living, or getting
			a living, there is going to be a crash
			sometime. Then a sense of emptiness after the
			crash which will call us to our senses. The
			specialist’s view of the world logically narrows
			itself down to a race of nonentities for nothings.
			And even if a thing is a thing, it is a nothing
			to a nonentity. And if it is the one business
			of the specialist to obtain results, and we are
			all browbeaten into being specialists, but one
			result is going to be possible. It is obvious
			that the man who is willing to sacrifice the
			most is going to have the most success in the
			race, crowd out and humiliate or annihilate
			the others. If this is to be the world, it is
			only men who are ready to die for nothing in
			order to create nothing who will be able to
			secure enough of nothing to rule it. One
			wonders how long ruling such a world will be
			worth while, a world which has accepted as
			the order of the day success by suicide, the
			spending of manhood on things which only by
			being men we can enjoy—the method of forging
			boilers and getting deaf to buy violins, of
			having elevated railways for dead men, wireless
			telegraphs for clods, gigantic printing-presses
			for men who have forgotten how to read.
			“Let us all, by all means, make all things
			for the world.” So we set ourselves to our
			task cheerfully, the task of attaining results for
			people at large by killing people in particular
			<a class="pagenum" id="page392" title="392"> </a>off. We are getting to be already, even in
			the arts, men with one sense. We have classes
			even in colour. Schools of painters are founded
			by men because they have one seventh of a
			sense of sight. Schools of musicians divide
			themselves off into fractions of the sense of
			sound, and on every hand men with a hundred
			and forty-three million cells in their brains,
			become noted (nobodies) because they only
			use a hundred and forty-three. “What is the
			use of attaining results,” one asks, “of making
			such a perfectly finished world, when there
			is not a man in it who would pay any attention
			to it as a world?” If the planet were really being
			improved by us, if the stars shone better
			by our committing suicide to know their names,
			it might be worth while for us all to die, perhaps,
			to make racks of ourselves, frames for
			souls (one whole generation of us), in one
			single, heroic, concerted attempt to perfect a
			universe like this, the use and mastery of it.
			But what would it all come to? Would we
			not still be left in the way on it, we and our
			children, lumbering it up, soiling and disgracing
			it, making a machine of it? There would
			be no one to appreciate it. Our children would
			inherit the curse from us, would be more like
			us than we are. If any one is to appreciate this
			world, we must appreciate it and pass the old
			secret on.</p>

			<p>No one seems to believe in appreciating—appreciating
			more than one thing, at least.
			<a class="pagenum" id="page393" title="393"> </a>The practical disappearance in any vital form
			of the lecture-lyceum, the sermon, the essay,
			and the poem, the annihilation of the imagination
			or organ of comprehension, the disappearance
			of personality, the abolition of the editorial,
			the temporary decline of religion, of
			genius, of the artistic temperament, can all be
			summed up and symbolised in a single trait of
			modern life, its separated men, interested in
			separate things. We are getting to be lovers
			of contentedly separate things, little things in
			their little places all by themselves. The modern
			reader is a skimmer, a starer at pictures,
			like a child, while he reads, never thinking a
			whole thought, a lover of peeks and paragraphs,
			as a matter of course. Except in his money-making,
			or perhaps in the upper levels of
			science, the typical modern man is all paragraphs,
			not only in the way he reads, but
			in the way he lives and thinks. Outside of
			his specialty he is not interested in anything
			more than one paragraph’s worth. He is as
			helpless as a bit of protoplasm before the sight
			of a great many very different things being
			honestly put together. Putting things together
			tires him. He has no imagination,
			because he has the daily habit of contentedly
			seeing a great many things which he never puts
			together. He is neither artistic nor original nor
			far-sighted nor powerful, because he has a paragraph
			way of thinking, a scrap-bag of a soul,
			because he cannot concentrate separate things,
			<a class="pagenum" id="page394" title="394"> </a>cannot put things together. He has no personality
			because he cannot put himself together.</p>

			<p>It is significant that in the days when personalities
			were common and when very powerful,
			interesting personalities could be looked
			up, several to the mile, on almost any road
			in the land, it was not uncommon to see a
			business letter-head like this:</p>

			<div class="letterhead">
				<p>General Merchandise,</p>
				<p>Dry Goods, Notions, Hats,</p>
				<p>Shoes, Groceries, Hardware, Coffins</p>
				<p>and Caskets, Livery and</p>
				<p>Feed Stable.</p>
				<p>Physician and Surgeon.</p>
				<p>Justice of the Peace, Licensed to Marry.</p>
			</div>

			<p>If, as it looks just at present, the nation is
			going to believe in arbitration as the general
			modern method of adjustment, that is, in the
			all-siding up of a subject, the next thing it will
			be obliged to believe in will be some kind of an
			institution of learning which will produce arbitrators,
			men who have two or three perfectly
			good, human sides to their minds, who have
			been allowed to keep minds with three dimensions.
			The probabilities are that if the mind
			of Socrates, or any other great man, could have
			an X-ray put on it, and could be thrown on a
			canvas, it would come out as a hexagon, or an
			almost-circle, with lines very like spokes on
			the inside bringing all things to a centre.</p>

			<p>It is not necessary to deny, in the present
			<a class="pagenum" id="page395" title="395"> </a>emphasis of Things, that we are making and
			inspiring all Things except ourselves in a way
			that would make the Things glad. The trouble
			is that Things are getting too glad. They are
			turning around and making us. Nearly every
			man in college is being made over, mind and
			body, into a sort of machine. When the college
			has finished him, and put him on the
			market, and one wonders what he is for, one
			learns he is to do some very little part, of some
			very little thing, and nothing else. The local
			paper announces with pride that in the new
			factory we have for the manufacture of shoes
			it takes one hundred and sixty-three machines
			to make one shoe—one man to each machine.
			I ask myself, “If it takes one hundred and
			sixty-three machines to make one shoe, how
			many machines does it take to make one
			man?”</p>

			<p>The Infinite Face of The Street goes by me
			night and day. To and fro, its innumerable
			eyes, always the sound of footsteps in my ears,
			out of all these—jostling our shoulders, hidden
			from our souls, there waits an All-man, a great
			man, I know, as always great men wait, whose
			soul shall be the signal to the latent hero in us
			all, who, standing forth from the machines of
			learning and the machines of worship, that
			spread their noise and network through all the
			living of our lives, shall start again the old
			sublime adventure of keeping a Man upon the
			earth. He shall rouse the glowing crusaders,
			<a class="pagenum" id="page396" title="396"> </a>the darers of every land, who through the
			proud and dreary temples of the wise shall go,
			with the cry from Nazareth on their lips,
			“Woe unto you ye men of learning, ye have
			taken away the key of knowledge, ye have entered
			not in yourselves and them that were entering
			in, ye have hindered,” and the mighty
			message of the one great scholar of his day
			who knew a God: “Whether there be prophecies
			they shall fail, whether there be tongues
			they shall cease, whether there be knowledge
			it shall vanish away. Though I speak with
			the tongues of men and of angels, and have
			not love, I am become as sounding brass and
			tinkling cymbal,…”</p>

			<p>I do not forget of Him, whose “<span class="small_all_caps">I, IF I BE
			LIFTED UP</span>” is the hail of this modern world,
			that there were men of letters in those far-off
			days, when once He walked with us, who,
			sounding their brass and tinkling their cymbals,
			asked the essentially ignorant question
			of all outsiders of knowledge in every age—“How
			knoweth this man letters, never having
			learned?”</p>

			Reading the World Together</h4>

			<p>It is not necessary to decry science, but it
			should be cried on the housetops of education,
			the world around in this twentieth century,
			that science is in a rut of dealing solely with
			things and that the pronoun of science is It.
			While it is obvious that neuter knowledge
			should have its place in any real scheme of
			life, it is also obvious that most of us, making
			locomotives, playing with mist, fire and water
			and lightning, and the great game with matter,
			should be allowed to have sex enough to
			be men and women a large part of the time, the
			privilege of being persons, perchance gods, surmounting
			this matter we know so much about,
			rather than becoming like it.</p>

			<p>The next great move of education—the one
			which is to be expected—is that the educated
			man of the twentieth century is going to be
			educated by selecting out of all the bare knowledges
			the warm and human elements in them.
			He is going to work these over into a relation
			to himself and when he has worked them over
			<a class="pagenum" id="page398" title="398"> </a>into relation to himself, he is going to work
			them over through himself into every one else
			and read the world together.</p>

			<p>It is because the general habit of reading for
			persons, acquiring one’s knowledge naturally
			and vitally and in its relation to life, has been
			temporarily swept one side in modern education
			that we are obliged to face the divorced
			condition of the educated world to-day. There
			seem to be, for the most part, but two kinds
			of men living in it, living on opposite sides of
			the same truths glaring at each other. On
			the one hand the anæmically spiritual, broad,
			big, pallid men, and on the other the funny,
			infinitesimal, provincial, matter cornered, matter-of-fact
			ones.</p>

			<p>However useless it may seem to be there is
			but one way out. Some man is going to come
			to us, must come to us, who will have it in him
			to challenge these forces, do battle with them,
			fight with fog on one hand and desert on the
			other. There never will be one world in education
			until we have one man who can emphasise
			persons and things together, and do it
			every day, side by side, in his own mind.
			When there is one man who is an all-man, an
			epitome of a world, there shall be more all-men.
			He cannot help attracting them, drawing them
			out, creating them. With enough men who
			have a whole world in their hearts, we shall
			soon have a whole world.</p>

			<p>Whether it is true or not that the universe is

			on my own knowledge, as if I were of some
			importance in it. Shall I reckon with alkalis
			and acids and not reckon with myself? I say,
			“O great Nature, O infinite Things, by the
			charter of my soul (and whether I have a soul
			or not), I am not only going to know things,
			but things shall know <em>me</em>. I stamp myself

			“O, mighty Child, the stars thy companions.
			Stand up! Come out in the day! laugh the
			great winds to thy side. The sea, if thou wilt
			have it so, is thy frog-pond and thou shalt play
			with the lightnings in thy breast.”</p>

			<p>“Aye, aye,” I cry, “I know it! The
			youth of the world seizes my whole being. I
			hurrah like a child through all knowledge. I
			have taken all heaven for my nursery. The
			world is my rocking-horse. Things are not

			them.”</p>

			<p><a class="pagenum" id="page401" title="401"> </a>And now I go forth quietly. “Do you not

			I have faced nations in my heart. Great
			bullying, hulking, half-dead centuries I have
			faced. I have made them speak to me, and

			<p>All knowledge, I have said in my heart, instead

		See Next Chapter</h4>

		<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">It</span> is good to rise early in the morning, when
		the world is still respectable and nobody
		has used it yet, and sit and look at it, try to
		realise it. One sees things very differently.
		It is a kind of yawn of all being. One feels
		one’s soul lying out, all relaxed, on it, and
		resting on real things. It stretches itself on
		the bare bones of the earth and knows. On a
		hundred silent hills it lies and suns itself.</p>

		<p>And as I lay in the morning, soul and body
		reaching out to the real things and resting on
		them, I thought I heard One Part of me, down
		underneath, half in the light and half in the
		dark, laughing softly at the Other. “What is
		this book of yours?” it said coldly, “with its
		proffered scheme of education, its millenniums
		and things? What do you think this theory,
		this heaven-spanning theory of reading of
		yours, really is, which you have held up objectively,
		almost authoritatively, to be looked
		<a class="pagenum" id="page406" title="406"> </a>at as truth? Do you think it is anything after
		all but a kind of pallid, unreal, water-colour
		exhibition, a row of blurs of faintly coloured
		portraits of yourself, spread on space? Do
		you not see how unfair it is—this spinning out
		of one’s own little dark, tired inside, a theory
		for a wide heaven and earth, this straddling
		with one temperament a star?”</p>

		<p>Then I made myself sit down and compose
		what I feared would be a strictly honest title-page
		for this book. Instead of:</p>

		<div class="sample_title">
			<p class="larger">THE LOST ART OF READING</p>

			<p>A STUDY<br />
			OF<br />
			EDUCATION<br />
			BY<br />
			ETC.</p>
		</div>

		<p class="continued_paragraph">I wrote it:</p>


		<div class="sample_title">
			<p class="larger">HOW TO BE MORE LIKE ME</p>

			<p>A SHY<br />
			AT<br />
			EDUCATION<br />
			BY<br />
			ETC.</p>
		</div>

		<p>And when I had looked boldly (almost
		scientifically) at this title-page, let it mock me
		a little, had laughed and sighed over it, as I
		ought, there came a great hush from I know
		not where. I remembered it was the title,
		<a class="pagenum" id="page407" title="407"> </a>after all, for better or worse, in some sort or
		another, of every book I had craved and delighted
		in, in the whole world. Then suddenly
		I found myself before this book, praying to it,
		and before every struggling desiring-book of
		every man, of other men, where it has prayed
		before, and I dared to look my title in the face.
		I have not denied—I do not need to deny—that
		what I have uncovered here is merely my
		own soul’s glimmer—my interpretation—at this
		mighty, passing show of a world, and it comes
		to you, Oh Gentle Reader, not as I am, but as I
		would like to be. Out of chaos it struggles to
		you, and defeat—can you not see it?—and if but
		the benediction of what I, or you, or any man
		would like to be will come and rest on it, it is
		enough. Take it first and last, it is written in
		every man’s soul, be his theory whatsoever it
		may of this great wondering world—wave
		after wave of it, shuddering and glorying over
		him—it is written after all that he does not
		know that anything is, can be, or has been in
		this world until he possesses it, or misses possessing
		it himself—feels it slipping from him.
		It is in what a man is, has, or might have, that
		he must track out his promise for a world. His
		life is his prayer for the ages as long as he lives,
		and what he is, and what he is trying to be,
		sings and prays for him, says masses for his
		soul under the stars, and in the presence of all
		peoples, when he is dead. By this truth, I
		and my book with you, Gentle Reader, must
		<a class="pagenum" id="page408" title="408"> </a>stand or fall. Even now as I bend over the
		click of my typewriter, the years rise dim and
		flow over me out of the east, … generations
		of brothers, out of the mist of heaven and
		out of the dust of the earth, trooping across
		the world, and wondering at it, come and go,
		and out of all these there shall not be one, no
		not one, Gentle Reader, but shall be touched
		and loved by you, by me. In light out of
		shadow or in the shadow out of the light, our
		souls fleck them, fleck them with the invisible,
		blessing them and cursing them. We shall be
		the voices of the night and day to them, shall
		live a shadow of life with them, and be the
		sounds in their ears; did any man think that
		what we are, and what we are trying to be, is
		ours, is private, is for ourselves? Boundlessly,
		helplessly scattered on the world, upon the
		faces of our fellows, our souls mock to us or
		sing to us forever.</p>

		<p>So if I have opened my windows to you, say
		not it is because I have dared. It is because I
		have not dared. I have said I will protect
		my soul with the street. I will have my vow
		written on my forehead. I will throw open
		my window to the passer-by. Fling it in! I
		beg you, oh world, whatever it is, be it prayer
		or hope or jest. It is mine. I have vowed
		to live with it, to live out of it—so long as
		I feel your footsteps under my casement, and
		know that your watch is upon my days, and
		that you hold me to myself. I have taken for
		<a class="pagenum" id="page409" title="409"> </a>my challenge or for my comrade, I know not
		which, a whole world.</p>

		<p>And what shall a man give in exchange for
		a whole world?</p>

		<p>And my soul said “He shall not save nor
		keep back himself.”</p>

		<p>Who is the Fool—that I should be always
		taking all this trouble for him,—tiptoeing up
		and down the world with my little cover over
		my secret for him? To defy a Fool, I have
		said, speak your whole truth. Then God
		locks him out. To hide a secret, have enough
		of it. Hide it outdoors. Why should a man
		take anything less than a world to hide in?
		If a soul is really a soul, why should it not fall
		back for its reserve on its own infinity? God
		does. Even daisies do it. It is too big a
		world to be always bothering about one’s secret
		in it. “Who has time for it?” I have said.
		“Give it out. Move right on living. Get
		another.” The only way for a man in this
		twentieth century to hide his soul is by letting
		it reach out of sight. Not by locks, nor by
		stiflings, nor by mean little economizings of
		the heart does a man earn a world for a comrade.
		Let the laughers laugh. On the great
		still street in space where souls are,—who
		cares?</p>

		Diagnosis</h4>

		<p>Compelled as I am, as most of us are, to witness
		the unhappy spectacle, in every city of the
		land, of a great mass of unfortunate and mutilated
		persons whirled round and round in rows,
		in huge reading-machines, being crunched and
		educated, it is very hard not to rush thoughtlessly
		in to the rescue sometimes, even if one
		has nothing better than such a pitiful, helpless
		thing as good advice.</p>

		<p>I am afraid it does not look very wise to do
		it. Civilisation is such a vast, hypnotising,
		polarising spectacle, has the stage so fully to
		itself, everybody’s eyes glued on it, it is hard
		to get up and say what one thinks in it. One
		cannot find anything equally objective to say
		it with. One feels as if calling attention to
		one’s self, to the little, private, shabby theatre
		of one’s own mind. It is as if in a great theatre
		(on a back seat in it) one were to get up and
		stand in his chair and get the audience to
		turn round, and say, “Ladies and gentlemen.
		That is not the stage, with the foot-lights over
		there. This is the stage, here where I am.
		Now watch me twirl my thumbs.”</p>

		<p>But the great spectacle of the universal
		reading-machine is too much for me. Before
		I know it I try to get the audience to turn
		around.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page411" title="411"> </a>The spectacle of even a single lad, in his
		more impressionable and possible years, reading
		a book whether he has anything to do with
		it or not, in spite of the author and in spite of
		himself, when one considers how many books
		he might read which really belong to him, is
		enough to make a mere reformer or outlaw or
		parent-interferer of any man who is compelled
		to witness it.</p>

		<p>But it seems that the only way to interfere
		with one of these great reading-machines is to
		stop the machine. One would say theoretically
		that it would not take very much to stop it—a
		mere broken thread of thought would do it, if
		the machine had any provision for thoughts.
		As it is, one can only stand outside, watch it
		through the window, and do what all outsiders
		are obliged to do, shout into the din a little
		good advice. If this good advice were to be
		summed up in a principle or prepared for a
		text-book it would be something like this:</p>

		<p>The whole theory of our prevailing education
		is a kind of unanimous, colossal, “I can’t,”
		“You can’t”; chorus, “We all of us together
		can’t.” The working principle of public-school
		education, all the way from its biggest
		superintendents or overseers down to its littlest
		tow-heads in the primary rooms, is a huge,
		overbearing, overwhelming system of not expecting
		anything of anybody. Everything is
		arranged throughout with reference to not-expecting,
		and the more perfectly a system works
		<a class="pagenum" id="page412" title="412"> </a>without expecting, or needing to expect, the
		more successful it is represented to be. The
		public does not expect anything of the politicians.
		The politicians do not expect anything
		of the superintendents. The superintendents
		do not expect anything of the teachers, and
		the teachers do not expect anything of the
		pupils, and the pupils do not expect anything
		of themselves. That is to say, the whole educational
		world is upside down,—so perfectly
		and regularly and faultlessly upside down that
		it is almost hopeful. All one needs to do is to
		turn it accurately and carefully over at every
		point and it will work wonderfully.</p>

		<p>To turn it upside down, have teachers that
		believe something.</p>

		Eclipse</h4>

		<p>When it was decreed in the course of the
		nineteenth century that the educational world
		should pass over from the emphasis of persons
		to the emphasis of things, it was decreed that a
		generation that could not emphasise persons
		in its knowledge could not know persons. A
		generation which knows things and does not
		know persons naturally believes in things more
		than it believes in persons.</p>

		<p>Even an educator who is as forward-looking
		and open to human nature as President Charles
		<a class="pagenum" id="page413" title="413"> </a>F. Thwing, with all his emphasis of knowing
		persons and believing in persons as a basis for
		educational work, seems to some of us to give
		an essentially unbelieving and pessimistic
		classification of human nature for the use of
		teachers.</p>

		<p>“Early education,” says President Thwing,
		“occupies itself with description (geometry,
		space, arithmetic, time, science, the world of
		nature). Later education with comparison
		and relations.” If one asks, “Why not both
		together? Why learn facts at one time and
		their relations at another? Is it not the most
		vital possible way to learn facts to learn them
		in their relations?”—the answer that would be
		generally made reveals that most teachers are
		pessimists, that they have very small faith in
		what can be expected of the youngest pupils.
		The theory is that interpretative minds must
		not be expected of them. Some of us find it
		very hard to believe as little as this, in any
		child. Most children have such an incorrigible
		tendency for putting things together that they
		even put them together wrong rather than not
		put them together at all. Under existing educational
		conditions a child is more of a philosopher
		at six than he is at twenty-six.</p>

		<p>The third stage of education for which Dr.
		Thwing partitions off the human mind is the
		“stage in which a pupil becomes capable of
		original research, a discoverer of facts and relations”
		himself. In theory this means that
		<a class="pagenum" id="page414" title="414"> </a>when a man is thirty years old and all possible
		habits of originality have been trained out of
		him, he should be allowed to be original. In
		practice it means removing a man’s brain for
		thirty years and then telling him he can think.
		There never has been a live boy in a school as
		yet that would allow himself to be educated in
		this way if he could help it. All the daily
		habits of his mind resent it. It is a pessimistic,
		postponing way of educating him. It
		does not believe in him enough. It may be true
		of men in the bulk, men by the five thousand,
		that their intellectual processes happen along in
		this conveniently scientific fashion, at least as
		regards emphasis, but when it is applied to any
		individual mind, at any particular time, in
		actual education, it is found that it is not true,
		that it is pessimistic. God is not so monotonous
		and the universe is not graded as accurately
		as a public school, and things are much
		more delightfully mixed up. If a great university
		were to give itself whole-heartedly and
		pointedly to one single individual student, it
		would find it both convenient and pleasant and
		natural and necessary to let him follow these
		three stages all at once, in one stage with one
		set of things, and in another stage with another.</p>

		<p>Everyone admits that the first thing a genius
		does with such a convenient, three-part system,
		or chart for a soul, is to knock it endwise.
		He does it because he can. Others would if
		they could. He insists from his earliest days
		<a class="pagenum" id="page415" title="415"> </a>on doing all three parts, everything, one set
		of things after the other—description, comparison,
		creation, and original research sometimes
		all at once. He learns even words all ways at
		once. All of these processes are applied to each
		thing that a genius learns in his life, not the
		three parts of his life. One might as well say
		to a child, “Now, dear little lad, your life is
		going to be made up of eating, sleeping, and
		living. You must get your eating all done up
		now, these first ten years, and then you can
		get your sleeping done up, and then you can
		take a spell at living—or putting things together.”</p>

		<p>The first axiom of true pedagogics is that
		nothing can be taught except the outside or
		letter of a thing. The second axiom is that
		there is nothing gained in teaching a pupil the
		outside of a thing if he has not the inside—the
		spirit or relations of it. Teachers do not
		dare to believe this. They think it is true
		only of men of genius. They admit that men
		of genius can be educated through the inside
		or by calling out the spirit, by drawing out
		their powers of originality from the first, but
		they argue that with common pupils this process
		should not be allowed. They are not
		worthy of it. That is to say, the more ordinary
		men are and the more they need brains, the
		less they shall be allowed to have them.</p>

		<p>Inasmuch, then, as the inside cannot be
		taught and there is no object in teaching the
		<a class="pagenum" id="page416" title="416"> </a>outside, the question remains how to get the
		right inside at work producing the right outside.
		This is a purely spiritual question and
		brings us to the third axiom. Every human
		being born into the world is entitled to a special
		study and a special answer all to himself. If,
		as President Thwing very truly says, “The
		higher education as well as the lower is to be
		organised about the unit of the individual student,”
		what follows? The organisation must
		be such as to make it possible for every teacher
		to study and serve each individual student as a
		special being by himself. In other words, if
		this last statement of Dr. Thwing’s is to be
		acted on, it makes havoc with his first. It requires
		a somewhat new and practically revolutionary
		organisation in education. It will
		be an organisation which takes for its basic
		principle something like this:</p>

		<p><em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Viz.</em>: The very essence of an average pupil
		is that he needs to be studied more, not less,
		than any one else in order to find his master-key,
		the master-passion to open his soul with.
		The essence of a genius is that almost any one
		of a dozen passions can be made the motive
		power of his learning. His soul is opening
		somewhere all the time.</p>

		<p>The less individuality a student has, the
		more he is like other students, the more he
		should be kept away from other students until
		what little individuality he has has been
		brought out. It is not only equally true of the
		<a class="pagenum" id="page417" title="417"> </a>ordinary man as well as of the man of genius
		that he must educate himself, but it is more
		true. Other people’s knowledge can be poured
		into and poured over a genius innocently
		enough. It rolls off him like water on a duck’s
		back. Even if it gets in, he organically protects
		himself. The genius of the ordinary man
		needs special protection made for it. As our
		educational institutions are arranged at present,
		the more commonplace our students are
		the more we herd them together to make them
		more commonplace. That is, we do not believe
		in them enough. We believe that they
		are commonplace through and through, and
		that nothing can be done about it. We admit,
		after a little intellectual struggle, that a genius
		(who is bound to be an individual anyway)
		should be treated as one, but a common boy,
		whose individuality can only be brought out by
		his being very vigorously and constantly reminded
		of it, and exercised in it, is dropped
		altogether as an individual, is put into a herd
		of other common boys, and his last remaining
		chance of being anybody is irrevocably cut off.
		We do not believe in him as an individual.
		He is a fraction of a roomful. He is a 67th or
		734th of something. Some one has said that the
		problem of education is getting to be, How can
		we give, in our huge learning-machines, our exceptional
		students more of a chance? I state a
		greater problem: How can we give our common
		students a chance to be exceptional ones?</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page418" title="418"> </a>The problem can only be solved by teachers
		who believe something, who believe that there
		is some common ground, some spiritual law of
		junction, between the man of genius, the natural
		or free man, and the cramped, <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</em>, artificial,
		ordinary one. It would be hard to name
		any more important proposition for current
		education to act on than this, that the natural
		man in this world is the man of genius.
		The Church has had to learn that religion does
		not consist in being unnatural. The schools
		are next to learn that the man of genius is
		not unnatural. He is what nature intended
		every man to be, at the point where his genius
		lies. The way out in education, the only believing,
		virile, man’s way out, would seem to
		be to begin with the man of genius as a principle
		and work out the application of the
		principle to more ordinary men—men of slowed-down
		genius. We are going to use the same
		methods—faster or slower—for both. A child’s
		greater genius lies in his having a more lively
		sense of relation with more things than other
		children. Teachers are going to believe that
		if the right thing can be done about it, this
		sense of a live relation to knowledge can be
		uncovered in every human soul, that there
		is a certain sense in which every man is his
		own genius. “By education,” said Helvetius,
		“you can make bears dance, but never create
		a man of genius.” The first thing for a
		teacher who believes this to do, is not to teach.</p>

		<p>There is a spirit in this book, struggling
		down underneath it, which neither I nor any
		other man shall ever express. It needs a nation
		to express it, a nation fearless to know
		itself, a great, joyous, trustful, expectant nation.
		The centuries break away. I almost
		see it now, lifting itself in its plains and hills
		and fields and cities, in its smoke and cloud-land,
		as on some huge altar, to supreme destiny,
		a nation freed before heaven by the mighty,
		daily, childlike joy of its own life. I see it as
		a nation full of personalities, full of self-contained,
		normally self-centred, self-delighted,
		self-poised men—men of genius, men who balance
		off with a world, men who are capable of
		being at will magnificently self-conscious or
		unconscious, self-possessed and self-forgetful—balanced
		men, comrades and equals of a world,
		neither its slaves nor its masters.</p>

		<p>I have said I will not have a faith that I
		have to get to with a trap-door. I have said
		that inspiration is for everybody. I have had
		inspiration myself and I will not clang down a
		door above my soul and believe that God has

		can have. I do not want anything, I will not
		have anything that any one cannot have. If
		there is one thing rather than another that
		<a class="pagenum" id="page420" title="420"> </a>inspiration is for, it is that when I have it I
		know that any man can have it. It is necessary
		to my selfishness that he shall have it. If
		a great wonder of a world like this is given to
		a man, and he is told to live on it and it is not
		furnished with men to live with, with men that
		go with it, what is it all for? If one could
		have one’s choice in being damned there would
		be no way that would be quite so quick and
		effective as having inspirations that were so
		little inspired as to make one suppose they
		were merely for one’s self or for a few others.
		The only way to save one’s soul or to keep a
		corner for God in it is to believe that He is a
		kind of God who has put inspiration in every
		man. All that has to be done with it, is to get
		him to stop smothering it.</p>

		<p>Inspiration, instead of being an act of going
		to work in a minute, living a few hundred
		years at once, an act of making up and creating
		a new and wonderful soul for one’s self, consists
		in the act of lifting off the lid from the
		one one has. The mere fact that the man exists
		who has had both experiences, not having
		inspiration and having it, gives a basis for
		knowledge of what inspiration is. A man who
		has never had anything except inspiration cannot
		tell us what it is, and a man who has never
		had it cannot tell us what it is; but a man who
		has had both of these experiences (which is
		the case with most of us) constitutes a cross-section
		of the subject, a symbol of hope for
		<a class="pagenum" id="page421" title="421"> </a>every one. All who have had not-inspirations
		and inspirations both know that the origin
		and control and habit of inspiration, are all of
		such a character as to suggest that it is the
		common property of all men. All that is
		necessary is to have true educators or promoters,
		men who furnish the conditions in which
		the common property can be got at.</p>

		<p>The only difference between men of genius—men
		of genius who know it—and other men—men
		of genius who don’t know it—is that the
		men of genius who know it have discovered
		themselves, have such a headlong habit of self-joy
		in them, have tasted their self-joys so
		deeply, that they are bound to get at them
		whether the conditions are favourable or not.
		The great fact about the ordinary man’s genius,
		which the educational world has next to reckon
		with, is that there are not so many places to
		uncover it. The ordinary man at first, or until
		he gets the appetite started, is more particular
		about the conditions.</p>

		<p>It is because a man of genius is more thorough
		with the genius he has, more spiritual
		and wilful with it than other men, that he
		grows great. A man’s genius is always at bottom
		religious, at the point where it is genius,
		a worshipping toward something, a worshipping
		toward something until he gets it, a supreme
		covetousness for God, for being a God.
		It is a faith in him, a sense of identity and sharing
		with what seems to be above and outside,
		<a class="pagenum" id="page422" title="422"> </a>a sense of his own latent infinity. I have said
		that all that real teaching is for, is to say to
		a man, in countless ways, a countless “You
		can.” And I have said that all real learning
		is for is to say “I can.” When we have
		enough great “I can’s,” there will be a great
		society or nation, a glorious “We can” rising
		to heaven. This is the ideal that hovers over
		all real teaching and makes it deathless,—fertile
		for ever.</p>

		<p>If the world could be stopped short for ten
		years in its dull, sullen round of not believing
		in itself, if it could be allowed to have, all of
		it, all over, even for three days, the great
		solemn joy of letting itself go, it would not be
		caught falling back very soon, I think, into
		its stupor of cowardice. It would not be the
		same world for three hundred years. All that
		it is going to require to get all people to feel
		that they are inspired is some one who is strong
		enough to lift a few people off of themselves—get
		the idea started. Every man is so busy
		nowadays keeping himself, as he thinks, properly
		smothered, that he has not the slightest
		idea of what is really inside him, or of what
		the thing that is really inside him would do with
		him, if he would give it a chance. Any man
		who has had the experience of not having inspiration
		and the experience of having it both
		knows that it is the sense of striking down
		through, of having the lid of one’s smaller
		consciousness lifted off. In the long run his
		<a class="pagenum" id="page423" title="423"> </a>inspiration can be had or not as he wills. He
		knows that it is the supreme reasonableness in
		him, the primeval, underlying naturalness in
		him, rising to its rights. What he feels when
		he is inspired is that the larger laws, the laws
		above the other laws, have taken hold of him.
		He knows that the one law of inspiration is
		that a man shall have the freedom of himself.
		Most problems and worries are based on defective,
		uninvoked functions. Some organ,
		vision, taste, or feeling or instinct is not allowed
		its vent, its chance to qualify. Something
		needs lifting away. The common experience
		of sleeping things off, or walking or working
		them off, is the daily symbol of inspiration.
		More often than not a worry or trouble is
		moved entirely out of one’s path by the simplest
		possible device, an intelligent or instinctive
		change of conditions.</p>

		<p>The fundamental heresy of modern education
		is that it does not believe this—does not
		believe in making deliberate arrangements for
		the originality of the average man. It does
		not see that the extraordinary man is simply
		the ordinary man keyed-up, writ large or moving
		more rapidly. What the average man is
		now, the great men were once. When we begin
		to understand that a man of genius is not
		supernatural, that he is simply more natural
		than the rest of us, that all the things that are
		true for him are true for us, except that they
		are true more slowly, the educational world
		<a class="pagenum" id="page424" title="424"> </a>will be a new world. The very essence of the
		creative power of a man of genius over other
		men, is that he believes in them more than
		they do. He writes, paints, or sings as if all
		other men were men of genius, and he keeps
		on doing it until they are. All modern human
		nature is annexed genius. The whole world
		is a great gallery of things, that men of genius
		have seen, until they make other men see them
		too, and prove that other men can see them.
		What one man sees with travail or by being
		born again, whole generations see at last without
		trying, and when they are born the first
		time. The great cosmic process is going on
		in the human spirit. Ages flow down from
		the stars upon it. No one man shall guess,
		now or ever, what a man is, what a man shall
		be. But it is to be noticed that when the world
		gets its greatest man—the One who guesses
		most, generations are born and die to know
		Him, all with awe and gentleness in their
		hearts. One after the other as they wheel up to
		the Great Sun to live,—they call Him the Son
		of God because He thought everybody was.</p>

		<p>The main difference between a great man
		and a little one is a matter of time. If the little
		man could keep his organs going, could keep
		on experiencing, acting, and reacting on things
		for four thousand years, he would have no
		difficulty in being as great as some men are in
		their threescore and ten. All genius is inherited
		time and space. The imagination,
		<a class="pagenum" id="page425" title="425"> </a>which is the psychological substitute for time
		and space, is a fundamental element in all
		great power, because, being able to reach
		results without pacing off the processes, it
		makes it possible for a man to crowd more
		experience in, and be great in a shorter
		time.</p>

		<p>The idea of educating the little man in the
		same way as the great man, from the inside,
		or by drawing out his originality, meets with
		many objections. It is objected that inasmuch
		as no little men could be made into
		great men in the time allotted, there would be
		no object in trying to do it, and no result to
		show for it in the world, except row after row
		of spoiled little men, drearily waiting to die.
		The answer to this is the simple assertion that
		if a quart-cup is full it is the utmost a quart-cup
		can expect. A hogshead can do no more.
		So far as the man himself is concerned, if he
		has five sound, real senses in him, all of them
		acting and reacting on real things, if he is alive,
		i. e., sincere through and through, he is educated.
		True education must always consist,
		not in how much a man has, but in the way
		he feels about what he has. The kingdom
		of heaven is on the inside of his five senses.</p>

		Every Man his Own Genius</h4>

		<p>I do not mean by the man of genius in this
		connection the great man of genius, who takes
		hold of his ancestors to live, rakes centuries
		into his life, burns up the phosphorus of ten
		generations in fifty years, and with giant
		masterpieces takes leave of the world at last,
		bringing his family to a full stop in a blaze of
		glory, and a spindling child or so. I am merely
		contending for the principle that the extraordinary
		or inspired man is the normal man (at the
		point where he is inspired) and that the ordinary
		or uninspired boy can be made like him,
		must be educated like him, led out through
		his self-delight to truth, that, if anything, the
		ordinary or uninspired boy needs to be educated
		like a genius more than a genius does.</p>

		<p>I know of a country house which reminds
		me of the kind of mind I would like to have.
		In the first place, it is a house that grew. It
		could not possibly have been thought of all at
		once. In the second place, it grew itself.
		Half inspiration and half common-sense, with
		its mistakes and its delights all in it, gloriously,
		frankly, it blundered into being, seven
		generations tumbled on its floors, filled it
		with laughter and love and tears. One felt
		that every life that had come to it had written
		itself on its walls, that the old house had
		<a class="pagenum" id="page427" title="427"> </a>broken out in a new place for it, full of new
		little joys everywhere, and jogs and bays and
		afterthoughts and forethoughts, old roofs and
		young ones chumming together, and old chimneys
		(three to start with and four new ones
		that came when they got ready). Everything
		about it touched the heart and said something.
		I have never managed to see it yet, whether in
		sunlight, cloud-light, or starlight, or the light
		of its own lamps, but that it stood and spoke.
		It is a house that has genius. The genius of
		the earth and the sky around it are all in it,
		of motherhood, of old age, and of little children.
		It grew out of a spirit, a loving, eager, putting-together,
		a making of relations between things
		that were apart,—the portrait of a family. It is
		a very beautiful, eloquent house, and hundreds
		of nights on the white road have I passed it by,
		in my lonely walk, and stopped and listened to
		it, standing there in its lights, like a kind of
		low singing in the trees, and when I have come
		home, later, on the white road, and the lights
		were all put out, I still feel it speaking there,
		faint against heaven, with all its sleep, its
		young and old sleep, its memories and hopes
		of birth and death, lifting itself in the night, a
		prayer of generations.</p>

		<p>Many people do not care for it very much.
		They would wonder that I should like a mind
		like it. It is a wandering-around kind of a
		house, has thirty outside doors. If one
		doesn’t like it, it is easy to get out (which is
		<a class="pagenum" id="page428" title="428"> </a>just what I like in a mind). Stairways almost
		anywhere, only one or two places in the whole
		building where there is not a piazza, and every
		inch of piazza has steps down to the grass and
		there are no walks. A great central fireplace,
		big as a room, little groups of rooms that keep
		coming on one like surprises, and little groups
		of houses around outside that have sprung up
		out of the ground themselves. A flower garden
		that thought of itself and looks as if it took
		care of itself (but doesn’t). Everything exuberant
		and hospitable and free on every side
		and full of play,—a high stillness and seriousness
		over all.</p>

		<p>I cannot quite say what it is, but most
		country houses look to me as if they had forgotten
		they were really outdoors, in a great,
		wide, free, happy place, where winds and suns
		run things, where not even God says nay, and
		everything lives by its inner law, in the presence
		of the others, exults in its own joy and
		plays with God. Most country homes forget
		this. They look like little isles of glare and
		showing off, and human joylessness, dotting
		the earth. People’s minds in the houses are
		like the houses: they reek with propriety.
		That is, they are all abnormal, foreign to the
		spirit, to the passion of self-delight, of life, of
		genius. Most of them are fairly hostile to genius
		or look at it with a lorgnette.</p>

		<p>I like to think that if the principles and
		habits of freedom that result in genius were to
		<a class="pagenum" id="page429" title="429"> </a>be gauged and adjusted toward bringing out
		the genius of ordinary men, they would result
		in the following:</p>

		<p>Recipe to make a great man (or a live small
		one): Let him be made like a great work of
		art. In general, follow the rule in Genesis i.</p>

		<p>1. Chaos.</p>

		<p>2. Enough Chaos; that is, enough kinds of
		Chaos. Pouring all the several parts of Chaos
		upon the other parts of Chaos.</p>

		<p>3. Watch to see what emerges and what it is
		in the Chaos that most belongs to all the rest,
		what is the Unifying Principle.</p>

		<p>4. Fertilise the Chaos. Let it be impregnated
		with desire, will, purpose, personality.</p>

		<p>5. When the Unifying Principle is discovered,
		refrain from trying to force everything
		to attach itself to it. Let things attach
		themselves in their way as they are sure to do
		in due time and grow upon it. Let the mind
		be trusted. Let it not be always ordered
		around, thrust into, or meddled with. The
		making of a man, like the making of a work of
		art, consists in giving the nature of things a
		chance, keeping them open to the sun and air
		and the springs of thought. The first person
		who ever said to man, “You press the button
		and I will do the rest,” was God.</p>

		<p>The emphasis of art in our modern education,
		of the knack or science or how of things,
		is to be followed next by the emphasis of the
		art that conceals art, genius, the norm and
		<a class="pagenum" id="page430" title="430"> </a>climax of human ability. Any finishing-school
		girl can out-sonnet Keats. The study of appearances,
		the passion for the outside has run
		its course. The next thing in education is
		going to be honesty, fearless naturalness, upheaval,
		the freedom of self, self-expectancy,
		all-expectancy, and the passion for possessing
		real things. The personalities, persons with
		genius, persons with free-working, uncramped
		minds, are all there, ready and waiting, both
		in teachers and pupils, all growing <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">sub rosa</em>,
		and the main thing that is left to do is to lift
		the great roof of machinery off and let them
		come up. The days are already upon us when
		education shall be taken out of the hands of
		anæmic, abstracted men—men who go into
		everything theory-end first. There is already
		a new atmosphere in the educated world. The
		thing that shall be taught shall be the love of
		swinging out, of swinging up to the light and
		the air. Let every man live, the world says
		next, a little less with his outside, with his
		mere brain or logic-stitching machine. Let
		him swear by his instincts more, and live with
		his medulla oblongata.</p>

		An Inclined Plane</h4>

		<p>“This is a very pleasant and profitable ideal
		you have printed in this book, but teachers and
		<a class="pagenum" id="page431" title="431"> </a>pupils and institutions being what they are, it
		is not practical and nothing can be done about
		it,” it is objected.</p>

		<h5>RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED</h5>

		<p>1. There is nothing so practical as an ideal,
		for if through his personality and imagination
		a man can be made to see an ideal, the ideal
		does itself; that is, it takes hold of him and inspires
		him to do it and to find means for doing
		it. This is what has been aimed at in this
		book.</p>

		<p>2. The first and most practical thing to do
		with an ideal is to believe it.</p>

		<p>3. The next most practical thing is to act
		as if one believed it. This makes other people
		believe it. To act as if one believed an
		ideal is to be literal with it, to assume that it
		can be made real, that something—some next
		thing—can be done with it.</p>

		<p>4. It is only people who believe an ideal who
		can make it practical. Educators who think
		that an ideal is true and who do not think it is
		practical do not think it is true, do not really
		know it. The process of knowing an ideal, of
		realising it with the mind, is the process of
		knowing that it can be made real. This is
		what makes it an ideal, that it is capable of becoming
		real, and if a man does not realise an
		ideal, cannot make it real in his mind, it is not
		accurate for him to say that it is not practical.
		It is accurate for him to say that it is not practical
		<a class="pagenum" id="page432" title="432"> </a>to him. The ideal presented in this book
		is not presented as practical except to teachers
		who believe it.</p>

		<p>5. Every man has been given in this world,
		if he is allowed to get at them, two powers to
		make a man out of. These powers are Vision
		and Action. (1) Seeing, and (2) Being or
		Doing what one sees. What a man sees with,
		is quite generally called his imagination.
		What he does with what he sees, is called his
		character or personality. If it is true, as has
		been maintained in the whole trend of this
		book, that the most important means of education
		are imagination and personality, the power
		of seeing things and the power of living as if
		one saw them, imagination and personality
		must be accepted as the forces to teach with,
		and the things that must be taught. The persons
		who have imagination and personality in
		modern life must do the teaching.</p>

		<p>6. Parents and others who believe in imagination
		and personality as the supreme energies
		of human knowledge and the means of education,
		and who have children they wish taught
		in this way, are going to make connections
		with such teachers and call on them to do it.</p>

		<p>7. Inasmuch as the best way to make an
		ideal that rests on persons practical is to find
		the persons, the next thing for persons who
		believe in an ideal to do is to find each other
		out. All persons, particularly teachers and
		parents, in their various communities and in
		<a class="pagenum" id="page433" title="433"> </a>the nation, who believe that the ideal is practical
		in education should be social with their
		ideal, group themselves together, make themselves
		known and felt.</p>

		<p>8. Some of us are going to act through the
		schools we have. We are going to make room
		in our present over-managed, morbidly organised
		institutions, with ordered-around teachers,
		for teachers who cannot be ordered around,
		who are accustomed to use their imaginations
		and personalities to teach with, instead of
		superintendents. We are going to have superintendents
		who will desire such teachers. The
		reason that our over-organised and over-superintended
		schools and colleges cannot get the
		teachers they want, to carry out their ideals,
		is a natural one enough. The moment ideal
		teachers are secured it is found that they have
		ideals of their own and that they will not teach
		without them. When vital and free teachers
		are attracted to the schools and allowed fair
		conditions there, they will soon crowd others
		out. The moment we arrange to give good
		teachers a chance good teachers will be had.</p>

		<p>9. Others will find it best to act in another
		way. Instead of reforming schools from the
		inside, they are going to attack the problem
		from the outside, start new schools which shall
		stand for live principles and outlive the others.
		As good teachers can arrange better conditions
		for themselves to teach in their own schools,
		wherever practicable this would seem to be the
		<a class="pagenum" id="page434" title="434"> </a>better way. They are going to organise colleges
		of their own. They are going to organise
		unorganised colleges (for such they would
		be called at first), assemblings of inspired
		teachers, men grouping men about them each
		after his kind.</p>

		<p>Every one can begin somewhere. Teachers
		who are outside can begin outside and teachers
		who are within can begin within. Certainly
		if every teacher who believes something will
		believe deeply, will free himself, let himself
		out with his belief, act on it, the day is not
		long hence when the great host of ordered-around
		teachers with their ordered-around
		pupils will be a memory. Copying and appearing
		to know will cease. Self-delight and
		genius will again be the habit of the minds of
		men and the days of our present poor, pale,
		fuddling, unbelieving, Simon-says-thumbs-up
		education will be numbered.</p>

		<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

		<p class="post_thoughtbreak">Sometimes it seems as if this globe, this huge
		cyclorama of nations whirling in sunlight
		through stars, were a mere empty, mumbled
		repetition, a going round and round of the
		same stupendous stupidities and the same heroisms
		in human life. One is always feeling as if
		everything, arts, architecture, cables, colleges,
		nations, had all almost literally happened before,
		in the ages dark to us, gone the same round of
		beginning, struggling, and ending. Then the
		globe was wiped clean and began again.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page435" title="435"> </a>One of the great advantages in emphasising
		individuals,—the main idea of this book,—in
		picking out particular men as forces, centres
		of energy in society, as the basis for one’s programme
		for human nature, is the sense it gives
		that things really can begin again—begin anywhere—where
		a man is. One single human
		being, deeply believed in, glows up a world,
		casts a kind of speculative value, a divine wager
		over all the rest. I confess that most men I have
		seen seem to me phantasmagorically walking
		the earth, their lives haunting them, hanging
		intangibly about them—indefinitely postponed.
		But one does not need, in order to have a true
		joyous working-theory of life, to believe verbatim,
		every moment, in the mass of men—as
		men. One needs to believe in them very
		much—as possible men—larvæ of great men,
		and if, in the meantime, one can have (what
		is quite practicable) one sample to a square
		mile of what the mass of men in that mile
		might be, or are going to be, one comes to a
		considerable degree of enthusiasm, a working
		and sharing enthusiasm for all the rest.</p>

		Allons</h4>

		<p>I thought when I began to make my little
		visit in civilisation—this book—that perhaps I
		ought to have a motto to visit a civilisation
		<a class="pagenum" id="page436" title="436"> </a>with. So the motto I selected (a good one for
		all reformers, viewers of institutions and things)
		was, “Do not shoot the organist. He is doing
		the best he can.” I fear I have not lived up
		to it. I am an optimist. I cannot believe he
		is doing the best he can. Before I know it, I get
		to hoping and scolding. I do not even believe
		he is enjoying it. Most of the people in civilisation
		are not enjoying it. They are like people
		one sees on tally-hos. They are not really
		enjoying what they are doing. They enjoy
		thinking that other people think they are enjoying
		it.</p>

		<p>The great characteristic enthusiasm of modern
		society, of civilisation, the fad of showing
		off, of exhibiting a life instead of living it, very
		largely comes, it is not too much to say, from
		the lack of normal egoism, of self-joy in civilised
		human beings. It has come over us like a kind
		of moral anæmia. People cannot get interested
		enough in anything to be interested in it by
		themselves. Hence no great art—merely the
		art which is a trick or knack of appearance.
		We lack great art because we do not believe in
		great living.</p>

		<p>The emphasis which would seem to be most
		to the point in civilisation is that people must
		enjoy something, something of their very own,
		even if it is only their sins, if they can do no
		better, and they are their own. It would be
		a beginning. They could work out from that.
		They would get the idea. Some one has said
		<a class="pagenum" id="page437" title="437"> </a>that people repent of their sins because they
		didn’t enjoy them as much as they expected
		to. Well, then, let them enjoy their repentance.
		The great point is, in this world, that
		men must get hold of reality somewhere, somehow,
		get the feel, the bare feel of living before
		they try dying. Most of us seem to think we
		ought to do them both up together. It is to
		be admitted that people might not do really
		better things for their own joy, than for other
		people’s, but they would do them better. It
		is not the object of this book to reform people.
		Reformers are sinners enjoying their own sins,
		who try to keep other people from enjoying
		theirs. The object of this book is to inspire
		people to enjoy anything, to find a principle
		that underlies right and wrong both. Let
		people enjoy their sins, we say, if they really
		know how to enjoy. The more they get the idea
		of enjoying anything, the more vitally and sincerely
		they will run their course—turn around
		and enjoy something truer and more lasting.
		What we all feel, what every man feels is, that
		he has a personal need of daring and happy
		people around him, people that are selfish
		enough to be alive and worth while, people
		that have the habit and conviction of joy,
		whose joys whether they are wrong or right
		are real joys to them, not shadows or shows of
		joys, joys that melt away when no one is
		looking.</p>

		<p>The main difficulty in the present juncture
		<a class="pagenum" id="page438" title="438"> </a>of the world in writing on the Lost Art of
		Reading is that all the other arts are lost, the
		great self-delights. As they have all been lost
		together, it has been necessary to go after them
		together, to seek some way of securing conditions
		for the artist, the enjoyer and prophet of
		human life, in our modern time. At the bottom
		of all great art, it is necessary to believe,
		there has been great, believing, free, beautiful
		living. This is not saying that inconsistency,
		contradiction, and insincerity have not played
		their part, but it is the benediction, the great
		Amen of the world, to say this,—that if there
		has been great constructive work there has been
		great radiant, unconquerable, constructive living
		behind it. There is but one way to recover
		the lost art of reading. It is to recover the lost
		art of living. The day we begin to take the
		liberty of living our own lives there will be artists
		and seers everywhere. We will all be artists

		<p class="post_thoughtbreak">Well, here we are, Gentle Reader. We are
		rounding the corner of the last paragraph.
		Time stretches out before us. On the great
		highroad we stand together in the dawn—I
		with my little book in hand, you, perhaps,
		with yours. The white road reaches away before
		us, behind us. There are cross-roads.
		There are parallels, too. Sometimes when
		there falls a clearness on the air, they are
		<a class="pagenum" id="page439" title="439"> </a>nearer than I thought. I hear crowds trudging
		on them in the dark, singing faintly. I
		hear them cheering in the dark.</p>

		<p>But this is my way, right here. See the hill
		there? That is my next one. The sun in a
		minute. You are going my way, comrade?…
		You are not going my way? So be
		it. God be with you. The top o’ the morning
		to you. I pass on.</p>

		<p class="ad_book_title">I—FRENCH LIFE IN TOWN AND COUNTRY</p>
		<p class="ad_book_author">By <span class="special_name">Hannah Lynch</span>.</p>
		<p>“Miss Lynch’s pages are thoroughly interesting and suggestive. Her
		style, too, is not common. It is marked by vivacity without any
		drawback of looseness, and resembles a stream that runs strongly and
		evenly between walls. It is at once distinguished and useful…. Her
		five-page description (not dramatization) of the grasping Paris
		landlady is a capital piece of work…. Such well-finished portraits
		are frequent in Miss Lynch’s book, which is small, inexpensive, and of
		a real excellence.”—<cite>The London Academy</cite>.</p>
		<p>“Miss Lynch’s book is particularly notable. It is the first of a
		series describing the home and social life of various European
		peoples—a series long needed and sure to receive a warm welcome. Her
		style is frank, vivacious, entertaining, captivating, just the kind
		for a book which is not at all statistical, political, or
		controversial. A special excellence of her book, reminding one of Mr.
		Whiteing’s, lies in her continual contrast of the English and the
		French, and she thus sums up her praises: ‘The English are admirable:
		the French are lovable.’”—<cite>The Outlook</cite>.</p>

		<p class="ad_book_title">II—GERMAN LIFE IN TOWN AND COUNTRY</p>
		<p class="ad_book_author">By <span class="special_name">W. H. Dawson</span>, author of “Germany and the
		Germans,” etc.</p>
		<p>“The book is as full of correct, impartial, well-digested, and
		well-presented information as an egg is of meat. One can only
		recommend it heartily and without reserve to all who wish to gain an
		insight into German life. It worthily presents a great nation, now the
		greatest and strongest in Europe.”—<cite>Commercial Advertiser</cite>.</p>

		<p class="ad_book_title">III—RUSSIAN LIFE IN TOWN AND COUNTRY</p>
		<p class="ad_book_author">By <span class="special_name">Francis H. E. Palmer</span>, sometime Secretary to H. H. Prince
		Droutskop-Loubetsky (Equerry to H. M. the Emperor of Russia).</p>
		<p>“We would recommend this above all other works of its character to
		those seeking a clear general understanding of Russian life,
		character, and conditions, but who have not the leisure or inclination
		to read more voluminous tomes … It cannot be too highly recommended,
		for it conveys practically all that well-informed people should know
		of ‘Our European Neighbours.’”—<cite>Mail and Express</cite>.</p>

		<p class="ad_book_title">IV—DUTCH LIFE IN TOWN AND COUNTRY</p>
		<p class="ad_book_author">By <span class="special_name">P. M. Hough</span>, B.A.</p>
		<p>Not alone for its historic past is Holland interesting, but also for
		the paradox which it presents to-day. It is difficult to reconcile the
		old-world methods seen all over the country with the advanced ideas
		expressed in conversation, in books, and in newspapers. Mr. Hough’s
		long residence in the country has enabled him to present a trustworthy
		picture of Dutch social life and customs in the seven provinces,—the
		inhabitants of which, while diverse in race, dialect, and religion,
		are one in their love of liberty and patriotic devotion.</p>
		<p>“Holland is always interesting, in any line of study. In this work its
		charm is carefully preserved. The sturdy toil of the people, their
		quaint characteristics, their conservative retention of old dress and
		customs, their quiet abstention from taking part in the great affairs
		of the world are clearly reflected in this faithful mirror. The
		illustrations are of a high grade of photographic
		reproductions.”—<cite>Washington Post</cite>.</p>

		<p class="ad_book_title">V.—SWISS LIFE IN TOWN AND COUNTRY</p>
		<p class="ad_book_author">By <span class="special_name">Alfred T. Story</span>, author of the “Building of the British Empire,”
		etc.</p>
		<p>“We do not know a single compact book on the same subject in which
		Swiss character in all its variety finds so sympathetic and yet
		thorough treatment; the reason of this being that the author has
		enjoyed privileges of unusual intimacy with all classes, which
		prevented his lumping the people as a whole without distinction of
		racial and cantonal feeling.”—<cite>Nation</cite>.</p>
		<p>“There is no phase of the lives of these sturdy republicans, whether
		social or political, which Mr. Story does not touch upon; and an
		abundance of illustrations drawn from unhackneyed subjects adds to the
		value of the book.”—<cite>Chicago Dial</cite>.</p>

		<p class="ad_book_title">VI.—SPANISH LIFE IN TOWN AND COUNTRY</p>
		<p class="ad_book_author">By <span class="special_name">L. Higgin</span>.</p>
		<p>The new volume in the fascinating series entitled “Our European
		Neighbours” ought to be of special interest to Americans, as it
		describes faithfully, and at the same time in a picturesque style, the
		social life of a people who have been much maligned by the casual
		globe-trotter. Spain has sunk from the proud position which she held
		during the Middle Ages, but much of the force and energy which charged
		the old-time Spaniard still remains, and there is to-day a determined
		upward movement out of the abyss into which despotism and bigotry had
		plunged her.</p>

		<p class="ad_book_title">VII.—ITALIAN LIFE IN TOWN AND COUNTRY</p>
		<p class="ad_book_author">By <span class="special_name">Luigi Villari</span>.</p>
		<p>The author, who is a son of Professor Villari of London, takes the
		point of view required by this series, <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">i. e.</em>, he looks on Italy with
		the eyes of an Englishman, and yet he has all the advantage of Italian
		blood to aid him in his sympathy with every detail of his subject.</p>
		<p>“A most interesting and instructive volume, which presents an intimate
		view of the social habits and manner of thought of the people of which
		it treats.”—<cite>Buffalo Express</cite>.</p>
		<p>“A book full of information, comprehensive and accurate. Its numerous
		attractive illustrations add to its interest and value. We are glad to
		welcome such an addition to an excellent series.”—<cite>Syracuse Herald</cite>.</p>

		<p class="ad_book_details">A Study of Feminism. Translated by George Herbert Ely. 8°. With
		portrait. <em>net</em>, $3.50</p>

		<p>“We have only admiration to bestow upon this most intricate and

		<p>“Everything is so brightly, so captivatingly important in this volume,

		<p>There is no one to whom Buffon’s phrase, <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le style c’est l’homme
		même</em>, may be more justly applied than to M. de Maulde. His work is
		absolutely himself; it derives from his original personality and his
		wide and sure learning an historical value and a literary charm almost
		unique. He is a wit with the curiosity and patience of the scholar,
		and a scholar with the temperament of the artist. The sparkle and
		humour of his conversation are crystallised in his letters, the
		charming expression of a large and generous nature.</p>
